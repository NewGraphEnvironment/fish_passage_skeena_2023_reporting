## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located `r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km
upstream of McDonell Lake, on a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`. The site is located on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)` and is within the Wet'suwet'en and Gitxsan hereditary territories.

<br>

## Background {.unnumbered}

At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with an
upstream watershed area of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_min')`m near the crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-8543)).

<br>

```{r tab-wshd-8543, eval = T}
fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) %>% 
  fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0('Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing ', my_site, '.'),
           footnote_text = 'Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above',
           scroll = F)

```

<br>

A summary of habitat modelling outputs is presented in Table
\@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-8543). A map of the watershed is provided in
map attachment
[`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r fpr::fpr_my_mapsheet(wshd = "kisp", archive_date = "2022-09-06")`).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {.unnumbered}

At the time of the survey in 2023, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was
un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-8543)). The culvert was in bad condition with holes in the bottom and had an outlet drop of 0.5m.

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {.unnumbered}

The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds') %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` value for salmonid rearing and spawning. 

<br>

## Stream Characteristics Upstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us')`  `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-8543-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-8543-d01))."))` `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` The stream was mostly dewatered but with isolated pools to 60 cm deep spaced every 30 to 40 m. The stream channel was entrenched in the valley with large amounts of mobile angular cobbled substrate throughout. Fish were observed in multiple isolated pools up to 300m upstream of the crossing, and there is a historic dolly varden observation just upstream of the crossing in the FISS database. The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us') %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` for salmonid rearing and spawning. There is a FISS obstacle noted as a cascade just upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` but no permanent natural barriers were observed.

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS
crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with a bridge
(`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m
span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at
\$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')` for a cost
benefit of `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_net)` linear
m/\$1000 and `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_area_net)`
m^2^/\$1000 with the relatively high costs of the work predicted primarily related to the large amount of road fill present at the site and the subsequent significant excavation required to install the large replacement structure.

<br>

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

The culvert at crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was in bad condition with holes in the bottom and had a significant outlet drop of 0.5m. The crossing ranked as a `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` to fish passage. There are historic fish observations both upstream and downstream of the crossing in the FISS database, and surveyors observed fish upstream of the crossing during the assessment, therefore,  we recommendation electrofishing above and below the crossing to provide insight into fish community composition and density to help further inform prioritization.
