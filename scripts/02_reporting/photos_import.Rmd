This is a simple script to bulk import all photos from a shared server to the local repo directory. Idea here is that 
all collaborators on raw project (who have access to the shared server) can add photos to the shared server alter
photos on the shared server (ie. organize, rename) and then update the repo. 

<br>

Naming conventions to allow `git` to track photos are included in the project `.gitignore` (ex. `_k_` included or photo
is named `crossing_all.JPG`).

<br>

This script keeps things very simple by first deleting all the photos locally, and then copying all the photos from the shared server to the local repo. A slightly more selective approach will be added to https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/fish_passage_skeena_2022_reporting/tree/main/scripts/02_reporting (at timeof writing this was in the
`scripts/tables_2023.R` script of that repo but it will be moved to align with this new convention.)

```{r copy, eval=TRUE}


# delete the mother photos directory
fs::dir_delete(
  paste0(here::here(), params$dir_repo_photos_stub)
  )
# create the new mother photos directory
fs::dir_create(
  paste0(here::here(), params$dir_repo_photos_stub)
  )

# copy over all the photos from the shared server to the local repo
fs::dir_copy(
  path = params$dir_server_photos_stub,
  new_path = paste0(here::here(),params$dir_repo_photos_stub),
  overwrite = TRUE)
```
