## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` 28km south-west of Houston, BC at approximately km 21 on the Morice-Owen Forest Service Road (FSR), approximately `r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km upstream from the confluence with the Owen River. A habitat confirmation assessment was conducted at the site in 2021 with the site revisited in the summer of 2022 for fish sampling (electrofishing and tagging). At the time of reporting, the Huckleberry Multi-Use Site was located immediately south of the subject stream at a location of approximately 1.1km upstream of the FSR.  A remote workcamp, the site is reported as housing up to 800-1200 workers employed to construct TC Energy’s Coastal GasLink (CGL) pipeline project.  Water for the camp (150,000 litres/day) is trucked in from the District of Houston with with another 150,000 litres/day of effluent trucked back to Houston from disposal [@burnslakelakesdistrictnews2022CoastalGasLink].

## Background {.unnumbered}

At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a
watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m at the crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-197379)). Upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_fish_sp()` have previously been recorded [@norris2022smnorrisbcfishobs]. A total of `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = total_lakereservoir_ha)`ha of lake and `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = total_wetland_ha)`ha of wetland is modelled upstream of the Forest Service Road (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-197379)). PSCIS stream crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a moderate
priority for follow up by @irvine2021BulkleyRiver with notes indicating than 1km of potential habitat but a very large channel width recorded in past PSCIS assessment. A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment
[`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r fpr::fpr_my_mapsheet(wshd = "morr", archive_date = "2022-09-06")`).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {.unnumbered}

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` had an outlet drop of 0.5m, was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result)` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol [@moe2011Fieldassessment]
(Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-197379)). Water temperature was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C, pH
was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'p_h')` and conductivity was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr::fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')`
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-197379-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-197379-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197379-d01))."))` `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` The stream had signs of high flow due to eroded banks. Habitat
below the culvert was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value with likely important rearing areas for coho and steelhead rearing during high flow events in the Owen Creek mainstem.

## Stream Characteristics Upstream {.unnumbered}

The stream was surveyed for 800m in a downstream direction to the culvert from the location of an approximately 8m high waterfall 
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-197379-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-197379-06)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197379-d02))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')`  Near the falls, bedrock dominated the stream substrate and the gradient was noted as 7%. The mixed decidous and coniferous forest riparian was noted as healthy. Pockets of gravel suitable for coho, steelhead and resident rainbow trout/cutthrout trout were observed. Overall, the habitat upstream of the FSR was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us')` value, containing habitat suitable for rearing and spawning of both anadromous as well as resident fish species.  Of note, when the site was revisited in 2022 the stream was primarily dewatered with numerous fish concentrated within isolated pools.

<br>

## Fish Sampling {.unnumbered}

Electrofishing was conducted in 2022 with results summarised in Tables \@ref(tab:tab-fish-site-197379) - \@ref(tab:tab-fish-dens-197379) and Figure
\@ref(fig:plot-fish-box-197379). A total of `r tab_fish_summary %>% filter(site_id == paste0(my_site, '_us')) %>% group_by(site_id) %>% janitor::adorn_totals() %>% filter(site_id == 'Total') %>% pull(count_fish)` fish were captured upstream and `r tab_fish_summary %>% filter(site_id == paste0(my_site, '_ds')) %>% group_by(site_id) %>% janitor::adorn_totals() %>% filter(site_id == 'Total') %>% pull(count_fish)` fish were captured downstream `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-197379-07) - \\@ref(fig:photo-197379-08)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197379-u01))."))` Although coho, dolly varden, rainbow trout and cutthrout trout (rainbow and cutthrout were potentially hybrd rainbow/cutthrout) parr (likely 1 year old fish) were captured downstream of the crossing, only rainbow trout and cutthrout trout were captured upstream. As noted, the stream was mostly dry at the time of electrofishing, with fish concentrated in pools. All fish over 60mm that were captured were tagged with Passive Integrated Transponders (PIT tags) with data stored [here](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/fish_passage_skeena_2022_reporting/blob/main/data/habitat_confirmations.xls).

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` on an unnamed tributary to Owen Creek was assessed for habitat characteristics in 2021 and for fish composition in 2022. As electrofishing in 2022 captured coho, dolly varden, rainbow trout and cutthrout trout (rainbow and cutthrout were potentially hybrid rainbow/cutthrout) parr (likely 1 year old fish) downstream of the crossing and only rainbow trout and cutthrout trout upstream, it appears as though the culvert was a barrier to upstream migration of coho and dolly varden spawners in 2021. Although intermittent streams experience periods without streamflow, residual pools within these systems can provide valuable habitat for juvenile salmon encouraging high growth rates and subsequent increased rates of overwinter survival [@ebersole_etal2006JuvenileCoho; @wigingtonjr_etal2006Cohosalmon].  @wigingtonjr_etal2006Cohosalmon measured overwinter survival rates of fish utilizing intermittent tributaries as higher than those in mainstem habitats with survival rates equivalent of those in perennial streams.  They noted that fish tagged in mainstems moved into intermittent tributaries when streamflow resumed in the fall and hypothesized that use of residual pools during dry periods and migration into these systems during times of increased flow can result in positive outcomes for these fish due to lower competitive fish densities and higher food resources when compared to coho in perennial tributary habitat.  Both @ebersole_etal2006JuvenileCoho and @wigingtonjr_etal2006Cohosalmon measured coho smolts from intermittent streams as considerably larger than those that used perennial habitats leading to greater overwinter survival illustrating the importance of maintaining connectivity in these systems. 

<br>

There was `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull= upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of habitat upstream of the culvert between the Morice-Owen FSR and the 8m high waterfall with habitat rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)` value for coho, steelhead and resident rainbow/cuthrout rearing and spawning. Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority)` priority for
proceeding to design for replacement. Of note, at the time of reporting, due to our prioritization work, a design for a replacement structure to more effectively facilitate upstream migration for all fish life stages and species was being developed by Mark Dewit from the Ministry of Forests.
