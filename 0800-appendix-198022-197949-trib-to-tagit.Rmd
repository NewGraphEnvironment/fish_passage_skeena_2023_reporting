## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)` are located on `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`, which flows in a southeast direction to Tagit Creek, approximately 45km west of Houston, BC within the Morice River watershed group. Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located `r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km upstream of Tagit Creek, and crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` a further 0.5km upstream. Downstream of the crossings, Tagit Creek flows southeast to Chisholm Lake then southwest to the Morice River approximately 5km downstream. Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)` with road tenure granted to West Fraser Mills Ltd. Crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` is located on a `r fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site2, col_pull = road_name)` of `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)` 
and is the responsibility of the Ministry of Forest.




## Background {.unnumbered}

`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with an
upstream watershed area of approximately `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m near the lower crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-198022-197949)).

<br>

In 2021, crossings `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)` were assessed with fish passage assessments
and prioritized for follow up with habitat confirmation assessments [@irvine2021BulkleyRiver]. Upstream of the crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_fish_sp()` have been documented in the past [@norris2024smnorrisbcfishobs; @moe2024KnownBC].

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)` {.unnumbered}

During the 2023 survey, both crossings were un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Tables \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-198022) - \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-197949)). Crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` 
had a 0.5m outlet drop with fish observed in the outlet pool. Water temperature was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C, pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'p_h')` and
conductivity was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

Approximately 175m east on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(dat = pscis_phase1, col_filter = my_crossing_reference, site = my_site3, col_pull = road_name)`, 
crossing `r as.character(my_site3)` was also assessed. The crossing was located within the same network of stream channels and
wetlands as the other two subject culverts but was not mapped within the Freshwater Atlas. The culvert was noted as rusting through
with some blockage of the culvert inlet caused by a beaver dam.  Photos and data are presented in Appendix - Phase 1 Fish Passage Assessments.

## Stream Characteristics Downstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` {.unnumbered}

<!-- 198022_ds says abundant gravels but the ef sites say limited gravels so not too sure what to go with here -->
`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')` to the confluence with Tagit Creek. The first 100m of stream was noted as
contained sporadic pools with a dewatered below. The stream flowed through a steep confined valley to Tagit Creek, where 
there was a large log jam at the confluence `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198022-01)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198022-d01 - \\@ref(fig:photo-198022-d02))."))` `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds') %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` value for salmonid rearing and spawning. 


## Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` and Downstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` {.unnumbered}

The stream was surveyed for approximately 500m from the upper crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` to the lower crossing `r as.character(my_site)` `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198022-03)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198022-d02))."))` 
Surveyors observed several fish in the outlet pool of the upper crossing. At the top end of the site there were occasional shallow pools and 
partial dewatering. At a location approximately 75m downstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` (`r fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site2, col_pull = road_name)`), the stream dewatered.   `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` There were abundant gravels present 
suitable for spawning. Approximatley 300m from the lower crossing, the stream converged with a primarily dry, willow and sedge dominated
wetland type area. The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us') %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` for salmonid rearing and spawning.

 

## Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us')`. Flow levels were noted as low with occasional dewatered patches `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197949-01)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198022-d02))."))` 
There were few deep pools with fish observed throughout the areas surveyed. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us')`
The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us') %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` value for salmonid rearing and spawning.

<br>


## Fish Sampling {.unnumbered}

Electrofishing was conducted above and below crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with the upstream site located just below crossing `r as.character(my_site2)`. The results are summarised in Tables \@ref(tab:tab-fish-site-198022) - \@ref(tab:tab-fish-dens-198022) and Figure
\@ref(fig:plot-fish-box-198022). A total of `r tab_fish_summary %>% filter(site_id == paste0(my_site, '_us')) %>% group_by(site_id) %>% janitor::adorn_totals() %>% filter(site_id == 'Total') %>% pull(count_fish)` cutthroat were captured upstream, and `r tab_fish_summary %>% filter(site_id == paste0(my_site, '_ds')) %>% group_by(site_id) %>% janitor::adorn_totals() %>% filter(site_id == 'Total') %>% pull(count_fish)` dolly varden was captured downstream `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198022-04) - \\@ref(fig:photo-198022-05)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198022-d03))."))` All fish captured with a fork length greater than 60mm were tagged with Passive Integrated Transponders (PIT tags) with data stored [here](`r paste0(params$repo_url, "blob/main/data/2023/habitat_confirmations.xls")`).

<br>

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, it is recommended that the crossings are replaced with `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site2, col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m span bridges. The preliminary cost estimate for each bridge is \$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')`.

<br>

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

There was `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull= upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of steelhead rearing habitat modelled upstream of crossing
`r as.character(my_site)` with approximatley 500m less modelled upstream of `r as.character(my_site2)`. Electrofishing confirmed the stream provides habitat to cutthroat trout with habitat value rated as 
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info() %>% stringr::str_to_lower()`. The sites were ranked as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` priorities for replacement.
