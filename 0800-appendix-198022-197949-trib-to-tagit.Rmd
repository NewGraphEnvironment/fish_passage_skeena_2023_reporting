## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)` are both situated on `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`, which flows in a southeast direction to Tagit Creek, approximately 1h15 drive from Houston, BC. Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located `r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km upstream of Tagit Creek, and crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` a further 0.5km upstream. Downstream of the crossings, Tagit Creek flow southeast to Chisholm Lake then southwest to the Morice River.

Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)` and at this location is the responsibility of West Fraser Mills Ltd. Crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` is located on a `r fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site2, col_pull = road_name)` of `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)` and at this location is the responsibility of the Ministry of Forest.

## Background {.unnumbered}

At both crossing `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with an
upstream watershed area of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation ranges from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m near the crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-198022-197949)).

In 2021, crossings `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)` were assessed with a fish passage assessment by @irvine2021BulkleyRiver, who observed nice gravels and fish upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` and suspected a beaver dam upstream of `r as.character(my_site)` due to slow moving water. Upstream of the crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_fish_sp()` have been documented in the past 
[@norris2024smnorrisbcfishobs; @moe2024KnownBC]. In 2023, both sites were prioritized for follow up with a habitat confirmation and fish sampling to investigate conclusions from the 2021 assessment, with results included in this report.

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` {.unnumbered}

During the 2023 survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was
un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-198022)). There were signs beaver activity and a large amount of road fill (2m) above the culvert, making for an expensive replacement. The habitat value was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info() %>% stringr::str_to_lower()`. Water temperature was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C,
pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'p_h')` and
conductivity was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm, which was substantially higher than at crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` upstream. The crossing was rated as a `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` priority for replacement.

Approximately 175m east on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(dat = pscis_phase1, col_filter = my_crossing_reference, site = my_site3, col_pull = road_name)`, crossing `r as.character(my_site3)` was also assessed. The crossing was situated on a small, un-mapped Freshwater Atlas stream, which fed into Tagit Creek. Wetland habitat was present both upstream and downstream of the crossing. The culvert was in poor condition, showing signs of rust and having holes. Additionally, there was some blockage at the culvert inlet caused by a beaver dam, resulting in a small drop at the inlet.

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` {.unnumbered}

During the 2023 survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` was
un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site2, col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-197949)). The culvert had a 0.5m outlet drop and low flows, and fish were observed in the outlet pool. The habitat value was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site2) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()`. Water temperature was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(sit = my_site2,loc = "us", col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C,
pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(sit = my_site2, loc = "us", col_pull = 'p_h')` and
conductivity was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(sit = my_site2, loc = "us", col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm. The crossing was rated as a `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, col_pull = priority) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` priority for replacement.

## Stream Characteristics Downstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` {.unnumbered}

<!-- 198022_ds says abundant gravels but the ef sites say limited gravels so not too sure what to go with here -->
`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')`, to the confluence with Tagit Creek. The first 100m of stream contained sporadic pools and then dewatered. The stream flowed through a steep confined valley to Tagit Creek, where there was a large log jam at the confluence `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198022-01)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198022-d01 - \\@ref(fig:photo-198022-d02))."))` `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds') %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` value for salmonid rearing and spawning. 

<br>

## Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` and Downstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` {.unnumbered}

The stream was surveyed from the upper crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` downstream to the lower crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, approximately 500m `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198022-03)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198022-d02))."))` At the top end of the site there were occasional shallow pools due to steeper gradients. Surveyors observed several fish in the outlet pool of the upper crossing. Approximately 75m downstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site2)`, the stream dewatered but contained abundant gravels. The remainder of the stream down to crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was a wetland type area, dominated by willow and sedge, with the main channel being difficult to find. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us') %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` for salmonid rearing and spawning.

 
<br>

## Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us')`. The channel was small with low flows and occasional dewatered patches `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197949-01)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198022-d02))."))` There were very few deep pools but fish were observed as far as 500m upstream of the crossing. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us')` The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us') %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` for salmonid rearing and spawning.

<br>


## Fish Sampling {.unnumbered}

In 2023, electrofishing was conducted above and below crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with the upstream site located just below crossing `r as.character(my_site2)`. The results are summarised in Tables \@ref(tab:tab-fish-site-198022) - \@ref(tab:tab-fish-dens-198022) and Figure
\@ref(fig:plot-fish-box-198022). A total of `r tab_fish_summary %>% filter(site_id == paste0(my_site, '_us')) %>% group_by(site_id) %>% janitor::adorn_totals() %>% filter(site_id == 'Total') %>% pull(count_fish)` cutthroat were captured upstream, and `r tab_fish_summary %>% filter(site_id == paste0(my_site, '_ds')) %>% group_by(site_id) %>% janitor::adorn_totals() %>% filter(site_id == 'Total') %>% pull(count_fish)` dolly varden was captured downstream `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198022-04) - \\@ref(fig:photo-198022-05)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198022-d03))."))` All fish captured with a fork length greater than 60mm were tagged with Passive Integrated Transponders (PIT tags) with data stored [here](`r paste0(params$repo_url, "blob/main/data/2023/habitat_confirmations.xls")`).

<br>

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, it is recommended that each crossing be replaced with a bridge of `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site2, col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m span. The preliminary cost estimate for each bridge is \$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')`.

<br>

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

Electrofishing in 2023 confirmed the stream provides valuable habitat to cutthroat trout, suggesting the stream may be important for spawning and rearing salmonids. The habitat value was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info() %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` for both crossings, with `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` priority for replacement.
