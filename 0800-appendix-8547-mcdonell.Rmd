## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` on `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is located on the south side of the Zymoetz River
approximately `r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km upstream of McDonell Lake, on the 
`r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)`. The road at the crossing location is the responsibility of the Wetzinkwa Community Forest Corporation.

<br>

## Background {.unnumbered}

At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with an
upstream watershed area of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m at the crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-8547)).  The stream drains a small lake area estimated at 8.8ha in a south-east direction entering
McDonell Lake approximately 1km west of the lake inlet.


<br>

The crossing was originally assessed with a fish passage assessment by @viveiros2011FishPassage in 2010 with fish
sampling and replacement with an open bottomed structure recommended.  The site was visited by our field crews in 2022
and prioritized for follow up with a habitat confirmation in 2024 because relatively good flow volumes were observed
along with a significant outlet drop. Upstream of the crossing, no past fish information was available
[@norris2024smnorrisbcfishobs; @moe2024KnownBC] however a sockeye spawning location was noted as present within the
stream approximately 150m upstream from McDonell Lake and ~1200m downstream of the FSR. A modelled crossing was noted as
present within `bcfishpass` modelling outputs near the historic sockeye observation.

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {.unnumbered}

At the time of the survey in 2023, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was
un-embedded, non-backwatered, had an oulet drop of 0.7m and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-8547)). Water temperature was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C,
pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'p_h')` and
conductivity was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

```

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')`. This section of stream was shallow with slow moving water and had some shallow pools with large rocks for fish shelter.  
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-8547-01)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-8547-d01))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value for salmonid rearing and spawning. 

<br>

Approximately 1.2km downstream of the FSR, the location of PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` was also assessed. The
crossing had been removed. The stream was surveyed upstream the mapped location of crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` for 100m. 
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds2')` There were abundant gravels, few deep pools, and multiple shallow pools up to 20-25cm deep `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-8547-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-8547-d01))."))`  
Surveyors observed numerous fry and parr and noted the stream had good flow considering the time of year and low flows 
observed elsewhere in the watershed. The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds2') %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` 
value for salmonid rearing and spawning. 

<br>

## Stream Characteristics Upstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us')`  `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-8547-03)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-8547-d02))."))` `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` The stream channel was small and moderately steep, 
with modest flow. There were very few areas with gravels suitable for spawning and not many deep pools. Other than the 
culvert no natural or anthroprogenic barriers were observed. The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us') %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` 
for salmonid rearing and spawning.

<br>

## Fish Sampling {.unnumbered}

 Electrofishing was conducted at three sites above and three sites below the FSR crossing,  with results summarised in Tables \@ref(tab:tab-fish-site-8547) - \@ref(tab:tab-fish-dens-8547) and Figure
\@ref(fig:plot-fish-box-8547). A total of `r tab_fish_summary %>% filter(site_id == paste0(my_site, '_us')) %>% group_by(site_id) %>% janitor::adorn_totals() %>% filter(site_id == 'Total') %>% pull(count_fish)` fish were captured upstream and `r tab_fish_summary %>% filter(site_id == paste0(my_site, '_ds')) %>% group_by(site_id) %>% janitor::adorn_totals() %>% filter(site_id == 'Total') %>% pull(count_fish)` fish were captured downstream, all of which were cutthroat trout `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-8547-04))")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-8547-d02))."))` All fish captured with a fork length greater than 60mm were tagged with Passive Integrated Transponders (PIT tags) with data stored [here](`r paste0(params$repo_url, "blob/main/data/2023/habitat_confirmations.xls")`).

<br>

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS
crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with an embedded culvert (streambed simulation) 
(`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m
span) is recommended. A preliminary cost of the work is estimated at
\$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')`.

<br>

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

Electrofishing surveys in 2023 captured cutthrout trout upstream and downstream of the FSR with densities of fish
captured indicating the stream is productive and provides habitat suitable for rearing and spawning. The small lake at the 
headwaters of the stream likely moderates water temperature and flows in the system providing a suitable environment for
salmonids. Habitat upstream of the crossing was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info() %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` value 
for salmonid rearing and spawning with the site rated as a `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` 
priority for replacement.  As the stream is relatively small, it may be possible to replace the crossing with a 
streambed simulation culvert (embedded 3m pipe) to provide fish passage and maintain the natural stream channel while
providing a cost effective solution.
