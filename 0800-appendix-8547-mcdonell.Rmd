## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located `r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km
upstream of McDonell Lake, on the
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`. The site is located on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)` and is within the Wet'suwet'en and Gitxsan hereditary territories.

<br>

## Background {.unnumbered}

At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with an
upstream watershed area of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_min')`m near the crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-8547)).

<br>

There has been restoration work completed at crossing `r as.character(my_site)` lead by the Office of the Wet'suwet'en and Gitxsan Huwilp Government.

<br>

Approximately 1.2km downstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site2)`, which was also assessed because there is a historic FISS sockeye spawning location just upstream. 

<br>

```{r tab-wshd-8547, eval = T}
fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) %>% 
  fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0('Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing ', my_site, '.'),
           footnote_text = 'Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above',
           scroll = F)

```

<br>

A summary of habitat modelling outputs is presented in Table
\@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-8547). A map of the watershed is provided in

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {.unnumbered}

At the time of the survey in 2023, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was
un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-8547)). There were two round culverts, but one was installed too high above the stream channel and was not functional. The functioning culvert had an inlet drop of 0.7m. Water temperature was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C,
pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'p_h')` and
conductivity was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

`r if(identical(gitbook_on, FALSE)){knitr::asis_output("\\pagebreak")}`

```{r tab-culvert-8547, eval = T}
fpr::fpr_table_cv_summary_memo()

```

```{r eval=F}
##this is useful to get some comments for the report
hab_site %>% filter(site == my_site & location == 'ds') %>% pull(comments)
hab_site %>% filter(site == my_site & location == 'us') %>% pull(comments)

```

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')`. This section of stream was shallow with slow moving water and had some shallow pools with large rocks for fish shelter.  
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-8547-01)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-8547-d01))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value for salmonid rearing and spawning. 

<br>

Approximately 1.2km downstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site2)`, which was also assessed because there was a historic FISS sockeye spawning location just upstream. The crossing was rated as a barrier but was a in fact a ford. The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` for 100m. There were with abundant gravels present, few deep pools were observed but there was multiple shallow pools up to 20-25cm deep `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-8547-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-8547-d01))."))`. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds2')`. Surveyors observed numerous fry and parr and noted the stream had good flow considering the time of year and dryness of the year. The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds2')` value for salmonid rearing and spawning. 

<br>

## Stream Characteristics Upstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us')`  `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-8547-03)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-8547-d02))."))` `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` The stream channel was small and moderately steep, with modest flow. There were very few areas with gravels suitable for spawning and not many deep pools. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` No barriers were observed. The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us')` for salmonid rearing and spawning.

<br>

## Fish Sampling {.unnumbered}

 Electrofishing was conducted at three sites above and three sites below crossing `r as.character(my_site)`,  with results summarised in Tables \@ref(tab:tab-fish-site-8547) - \@ref(tab:tab-fish-dens-8547) and Figure
\@ref(fig:plot-fish-box-8547). A total of `r tab_fish_summary %>% filter(site_id == paste0(my_site, '_us')) %>% group_by(site_id) %>% janitor::adorn_totals() %>% filter(site_id == 'Total') %>% pull(count_fish)` fish were captured upstream and `r tab_fish_summary %>% filter(site_id == paste0(my_site, '_ds')) %>% group_by(site_id) %>% janitor::adorn_totals() %>% filter(site_id == 'Total') %>% pull(count_fish)` fish were captured downstream, all of which were cutthroat trout `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-8547-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-8547-04)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-8547-d02))."))` All fish captured with a fork length greater than 60mm were tagged with Passive Integrated Transponders (PIT tags) with data stored [here](`r paste0(params$repo_url, "blob/main/data/2023/habitat_confirmations.xls")`).

<br>

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS
crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with a bridge
(`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m
span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at
\$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')` for a cost
benefit of `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_net)` linear
m/\$1000 and `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_area_net)`
m^2^/\$1000 with the relatively high costs of the work predicted primarily related to the large amount of road fill present at the site and the subsequent significant excavation required to install the large replacement structure.

<br>

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

The BC freshwater atlas streamline indicates the stream gradient upstream of the FSR at 7.5% which coincides approximately with stream measurements.  This value barely exceeds the 7.4% cutoff used in our reporting for modelling potential steelhead rearing habitat, so we elected to include an estimate of 0.8km of upstream habitat presetn suitable for steelhead rearing to a point where mapping indicates gradients increase to 11%. Areas surveyed were rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)` value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Although there were no dam structures located at the two mapped locations upstream of the crossing, Dale Creek watershed does provide the community of Kispiox with domestic water so it is possible there could be a dam or other diversion structure present farther upstream. Nevertheless, there were no natural or man-made barriers observed within the 800m of habitat assessed upstream of `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)` during the 2022 field surveys.

<br>


Following the 2022 survey, the site was ranked as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority)` priority for proceeding to design for replacement, with a recommendation to conduct electrofishing to help further inform prioritization. As also noted above, the site was revisited in September of 2023 with electrofishing conducted upstream and downstream of the crossing. Cutthroat trout and rainbow trout were captured upstream of with cuthroat, rainbow and dolly varden captured downstream. All fish over 60mm in size were tagged with PIT tags so that their movement and health can be tracked over time to help inform prioritization and effectiveness monitoring should restoration activities advance.
