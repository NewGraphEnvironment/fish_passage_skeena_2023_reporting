Multiple channels after first beaver dam, separated by heavily vegetated banks. Muddy bed material with some fines and gravels but nothing bigger. More gravels closer to downstream culvert that are suitable for spawning. Deep pools near wetland that can be suitable for rearing if habitat is opened up. 10:13:24"

Approximately 500m upstream of crossing. This is a high energy system with numerous areas of multiple channel and islands and elevated bars. High flows are pushing most large woody debris out of the main channel resulting in lower complexity and most cover available as boulders. there are rare pockets of gravel suitable for spawning. 13:44:56"

Steeper, smaller stream with extensive areas of gravel suitable for resident and anadronous salmonids. Multiple small steps from LWD/SWD at 20-40cm high. Amazing old growth riparian forest. 11:51"

High value habitat, abundant gravels suitable for resident and anadronous spawning. Debris in downstream section potentially an access issue. Frequent pools due to LWD in canyon that was not logged. 14:48"

Bed material consists of towels and boulders, also there are small packets of gravel suitable for spawning. Some features may be barrier natural barriers to Fish Passage, although during high flow there's a good chance strong fish can make it up. Plenty of pools available for fish to habituate, large wooden debris and small woody debris as well as boulders are quite functional and force complexity into the stream,. Stream is located mostly in a bed rock canyon, shrubs hang over the stream, taking up about 2 m on either side of the bank. 11:27:01"

Because the stream was primarily dewatered downstream of the outlet pool this site consisted of the outlet pool only. Only a portion of the fish present in the outlet pool were sampled due to time constraints. 12:48:19
22,Tributary to Owen Creek,197379_us_ef1,197379,us,ef1,2022-09-15,13:04:00,AI,11,,,,,,235.5s electrofishing. Shallow pools with very large boulder on right bank flat faced area isolated pocket because the majority of the channel is the water. Two passes of the same site we're done but fish or not separated into passes. Some uncertainty about whether Fish marked as cutthroat or actually rainbow. There are yellow slashes under the chin but the mouth does not reach past the eye and we haven't seen any larger age class fish with the/us. The big fish all appear to be rainbow having a suspect that the small ones may also be remote. Unless they're hybrids. During the fish processing process it appeared that it is very likely that all of the fish that were classified as cutthroat were actually rainbow. We didn't find any larger fish with red slashes and as the fish got larger it appeared the yellow slight yellow slashes underneath the chins caught lighter and lighter. 13:04:29
23,Sterritt Creek,198225_us,198225,us,,2022-09-26,12:50:00,JO,500,medium,moderate,1290,,,Has potential for fish but gradient is steep. Bank full depth is very high and when stream is high it fans out. Lots of lwd are main factor in stream direction and development. Other steams near creek water is higher may be one stream. 12:50:07
24,Sterritt Creek,198225_ds,198225,ds,,2022-09-28,10:12:00,JO,260,medium,moderate,,,,For the gradient of stream habitat is good. A lot of lwd to help with pools and water diversion as well as created natural steps. 10:12:00
