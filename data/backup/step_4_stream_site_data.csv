Isolated pools scattered approximately 30 to 50 m apart with pools           up to 0.6 m deep. Abundant algae in places of slow, moving water. Failing banks encountered throughout survey with Barbwire fence swapped into the stream at multiple spots. Occasional pockets of gravel present suitable for resident and anadromous salmonids. Conductivity increased from approximately 140 to 230 over the survey links indicating inputs possibly related to cattle use of the area. Extensive trampling within the channel with noted at locations throughout the survey.          10:55:05"
