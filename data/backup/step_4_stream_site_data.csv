Surveyed from Telkwa Hydro to confluence with Wiggs Creek.  Low water levels in stream with some sections dewatered, particularly in the first 300 m of the survey. Isolated pools scattered approximately 30 to 50 m apart with pools up to 0.6 m deep. Abundant algae in places of slow, moving water. Failing banks encountered throughout survey with Barbwire fence falling into the stream at multiple spots. Occasional pockets of gravel present suitable for resident and anadromous salmonids. Conductivity increased from approximately 140 to 230 over the survey,  indicating there could be inputs related to cattle use in the area. Extensive trampling within the channel was noted at locations throughout the survey.          10:55:05"

Although primarily dry,  the upper part of the site beyond the wetland area contained abundant gravels.
