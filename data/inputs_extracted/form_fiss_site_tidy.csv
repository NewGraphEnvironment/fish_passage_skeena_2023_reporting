Site surveyed from upper crossing down to lower crossing. Stream is dewatered approximately 75 m downstream of upstream crossing. Approximately 50m upstream of the road is wetland type area, dominated by willow and sedge. Several fish, approximately 70 mm long,  were observed in the outlet pool of the upper crossing. Although primarily dry,  the upper part of the site beyond the wetland area contained abundant gravels.  Residual pools were dry except some shallow ones near the top end of the site when gradients were greater.          10:54:14",2023-09-27
