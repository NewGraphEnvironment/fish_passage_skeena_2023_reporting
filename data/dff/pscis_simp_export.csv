Pipe is an extremely bad shape with extensive corrosion inside of the pipe particularly at the downstream and - see photos.  Likely at least one crossing downstream on private land.  Transmission line corridor is located immediately upstream and the channel appears to be modified in this location to be straighter and narrower than its natural state.  No crossing immediately upstream on Goslin Road (no road - crossing should be removed as potential barrier in bcfishpass)            Ministry of Transportation chris_culvert_id: 1465295. 14:28:28,,,,2023-10-05T14:28:28Z,,22201218

Model Crossing will need to be removed from bcfishpass. Outlet of this pipe is immediately upstream of Loseth road with significant armouring around the outlet, pool and road at the inlet downstream. Very nice stream with significant amounts of flow. Known rainbow stream. Much less flow downstream below Highway five, which is very interesting.           12:21:02",,,,2023-10-05T12:21:02Z,,22201951
