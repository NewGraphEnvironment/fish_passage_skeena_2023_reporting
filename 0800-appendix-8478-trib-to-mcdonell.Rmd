## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located `r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km
upstream of McDonell Lake on `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`, on the southwest side of the lake. BC Timber Sales (Timber Sales Manager Skeena) is responsible for the road at crossing `r as.character(my_site)`.

<br>

## Background {.unnumbered}

At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with an
upstream watershed area of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. This stream drains a steep cold water system, where the elevation ranges from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m near the crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-8478)).

<br>

The crossing was previously assessed with a fish passage assessment by @viveiros2011FishPassage in 2010, with a suggestions to follow up with fish sampling and replacement with a streambed simulation. Approximately 1.5km downstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)`there is a historic sockeye spawning location in the FISS database, and upstream `r fpr::fpr_my_fish_sp()` have been documented in the past [@norris2024smnorrisbcfishobs; @moe2024KnownBC]. Revisited in 2023, surveyors conducted a habitat confirmation assessment and electrofishing with results included in this memo.

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` {.unnumbered}

At the time of the survey in 2023, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was
un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-8478)). The culvert was slightly undersized for the size of the stream but was in good condition. Water temperature was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C,
pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'p_h')` and
conductivity was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

```

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {.unnumbered}

<!-- 8478_ds says abundant gravels but the ef sites say limited gravels so not too sure what to go with here -->
`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')`. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` The stream was steep with high flows and few areas with gravels suitable for spawning `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-8478-01)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-8478-d01))."))` There were few deep pools but fish were still present. Surveyors observed occasional small cascades with shallow outlet pools. The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds') %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` value for salmonid rearing and spawning. 

<br>

## Stream Characteristics Upstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us')``r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-8478-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-8478-d01))."))` `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` The stream was steep with high flows. There were small, periodic cascades, some created by large woody debris protruding over the channel, with the majority less than 1m in height. Surveyors observed a 0.7m high cascade roughly 200m upstream of the crossing and a second cascade, 1m in height, is noted 200m further upstream in the FISS database. Deep pools were sparse except at cascade outlets, and areas with spawning gravels were limited. The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us') %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` for salmonid rearing and spawning.

<br>


## Fish Sampling {.unnumbered}

During the 2023 survey, electrofishing was conducted at three sites below and one site above crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, with results summarised in Tables \@ref(tab:tab-fish-site-8478) - \@ref(tab:tab-fish-dens-8478) and Figure
\@ref(fig:plot-fish-box-8478). A total of `r tab_fish_summary %>% filter(site_id == paste0(my_site, '_us')) %>% group_by(site_id) %>% janitor::adorn_totals() %>% filter(site_id == 'Total') %>% pull(count_fish)` fish were captured upstream and `r tab_fish_summary %>% filter(site_id == paste0(my_site, '_ds')) %>% group_by(site_id) %>% janitor::adorn_totals() %>% filter(site_id == 'Total') %>% pull(count_fish)` fish were captured downstream, all of which were dolly varden. Multiple fish captured at this site displayed usual colouring on their gill plates, as seen in `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-8478-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-8478-04)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-8478-d02))."))` All fish captured with a fork length greater than 60mm were tagged with Passive Integrated Transponders (PIT tags) with data stored [here](`r paste0(params$repo_url, "blob/main/data/2023/habitat_confirmations.xls")`).


<br>

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS
crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with a bridge
(`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m
span) is recommended. Due to the large amount of road fill present at the site and the subsequent significant excavation required to install the large replacement structure, a preliminary cost of the work is estimated at
\$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')`.


<br>

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on a steep, cold water stream and provides quality habitat for dolly varden, based on the electrofishing results. Approximately 1.5km downstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` there is a historic sockeye spawning location in the FISS database, which suggest this stream could be provide suitable flows for rearing and spawning salmonids. The site was rated as a `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` 
priority for replacement containing `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info() %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Several of the fish captured had unusual colouring on their gill plates, perhaps indicating there are contaminants in the water. The culvert had a large amount of road fill making for an expensive replacement.
