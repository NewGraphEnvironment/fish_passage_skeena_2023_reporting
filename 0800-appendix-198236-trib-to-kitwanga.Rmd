## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`, on the `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)` `r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km upstream from the confluence with the Kitwanga River at a location 1.5km upstream of Kitwanga Lake (a.k.a Kitwancool Lake or Gitanyow Lake). There are two modelled crossing locations between the subject site and the Kitwanga River that have not yet been inventoried.  The first unasssessed crossing (modelled_crossing_id 8301996) is located on the `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)` 2.0km downstream of the subject site with the second a modelled crossing (modelled_crossing_id 8300438) on an unnamed road. Although field crews overlooked assessment of modelled crossing 8301996 they did attempt to access crossing 8300438 however this road had been deactivated with concrete blocks preventing all vehicle access including ATVs.  Review of aerial imagery indicates that the crossing structures (including 8300438) have been removed and fish access through this area is not likely hindered.

## Background {.unnumbered}

At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m near the crossing (Table \@ref(tab:tab-wshd-198236)). At the time of reporting, there was no fisheries information available for the areas upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)`. 

<br>

```{r tab-wshd-198236, eval = T}
fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) %>% 
  fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0('Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing ', my_site, '.'),
           footnote_text = 'Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above',
           scroll = F)

```

This tributary joins with the Kitwanga River before draining into Kitwanga Lake. This lake has an important value to fisheries in the area. Using salmon enumeration facilities to trap and count upstream migrating salmon, the Gitanyow Fisheries Authorities have proven that Kitwanga Lake is one of the most productive sockeye nursery lakes for its size in all of BC [@gitanyowfisheriesauthority2023KitwangaRiver]. The Kitwanga River salmon enumeration facility is located approximately 4km north of the confluence with the Skeena river. This facility provides counts of five species of salmon: sockeye, chinook, coho, chum, and pink. In response to rapid declines in sockeye stocks, the Kitwanga Lake Sockeye Restoration project was started in 2006.  Restoration efforts include environmental monitoring of the lake, assessment of sockeye spawning and rearing habitat, and hatchery rearing [@gottesfeld_etal2009CaseHistory].

PSCIS stream crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a moderate
priority for follow up by the Society for Ecosystem Restoration in Northern BC. A Fish Habitat Assessment Procedure was completed at this site in 2008 by members of the Skeena Fisheries Commission. At the time of assessment, it was concluded that the culvert presented a velocity barrier to juveniles. The habitat upstream was modelled at 8%. A summary of habitat modelling outputs is presented in Table
\@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-198236). A map of the watershed is provided in
map attachment
[`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r fpr::fpr_my_mapsheet(wshd = "kisp", archive_date = "2022-09-06")`).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {.unnumbered}

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was
un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()`
barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-198236)). There
was low flow through both culverts at the time of survey. Water temperature was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C,
pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'p_h')` and
conductivity was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')`
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198236-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-198236-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198236-d01))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` There was abundant overhanging vegetation and a lot of downed trees. The stream mainly consisted of gravels and cobbles. There were infrequent shallow pools suitable for rearing. The
habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value for
salmonid rearing and spawning.

## Stream Characteristics Upstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us')`
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198236-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-198236-06)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198236-d02))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` There were abundant gravels suitable for resident and anadromous salmonid spawning. There were frequent deep pools due to large woody debris in the canyon that was not logged. Overall, the habitat was rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us')` value.

<br>

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS
crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with a bridge
(`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m
span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at
\$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')` for a cost
benefit of `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_net)` linear
m/\$1000 and `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_area_net)`
m^2^/\$1000.

<br>

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

There was
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull= upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of
habitat modelled upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with
areas surveyed rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)`
value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority)` priority for proceeding to design for replacement.
