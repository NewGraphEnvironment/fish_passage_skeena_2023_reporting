## Site Location {.unnumbered}

Crossings `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)` are located on `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`, approximately `r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km and `r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(site = my_site2, col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km upstream of Houston Tommy Creek, respectively. The tributary flows southeast to Houston Tommy Creek, which then flows roughly 9km west to the Morice River. The sites are approximately 30km southwest of Houston, BC.

Crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` is located on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site2, col_pull = road_name)` and crossing `r as.character(my_site)` on a spur of `r fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site2, col_pull = road_name)`, which are both the responsibility of `r fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site2, col_pull = road_tenure)`.

<br>

## Background {.unnumbered}

At crossings `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with an
upstream watershed area of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m at the lower crossing `r as.character(my_site)` (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-198934)).

<br>

In 2002, Triton Environmental Consultants conducted a habitat assessment at crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, where they captured dolly varden above the crossing. The 2023 survey marked the first time these crossings underwent a culvert assessment. Surveyors also conducted a habitat assessment because the habitat appeared promising. In the past, `r fpr::fpr_my_fish_sp()` have been documented upstream of the crossing [@norris2024smnorrisbcfishobs; @moe2024KnownBC].

<br>

Approximately 700m upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` is PSCIS crossing 198941. This crossing also underwent a culvert assessment in 2023 due to its proximity to crossing `r as.character(my_site2)`.

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` {.unnumbered}

During the 2023 survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was found to be un-embedded, non-backwatered, and classified as a `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol  [@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-198934)). The culvert was bent in the middle and had a significant outlet drop of 0.7m. Surveyors observed excellent habitat both upstream and downstream of the crossing and noted fish in the outlet pool. The water temperature was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C,
pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'p_h')` and
conductivity was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm. The site was rated as a `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` priority for replacement. The crossing had 8m of road fill above the culvert, which would make replacement costly.

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` {.unnumbered}

At the time of the survey in 2023, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to 
the provincial protocol [@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-198934)). The culvert was in good condition but had a deep outlet pool, suggesting the pipe might be undersized for the stream. The site rated as a `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` 
priority for replacement. The water temperature was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(sit = my_site2, loc = "us", col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C,
pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(sit = my_site2, loc = "us", col_pull = 'p_h')` and
conductivity was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(sit = my_site2, loc = "us", col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

## Stream Characteristics Downstream of `r as.character(my_site)` {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')` `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198934-01)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198934-d01))."))` It contained high-value habitat with good flow and abundant cover. Although suitable gravel areas for spawning were infrequent, there were deep pools for overwintering fish, and fish were observed in the outlet pool of the culvert. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')`  Overall, the habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds') %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` value for salmonid rearing and spawning.

## Stream Characteristics Upstream of `r as.character(my_site)` and Downstream of `r as.character(my_site2)`{.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us')`, up to crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198934-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198934-d01))."))` 
The stream had abundant gravels but only occasional pools. Approximately 300m downstream of the upper crossing, on the left bank, there was a landslide roughly 30m high and 30m long `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198934-03)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198934-d02))."))` Below the landslide, sediments have caused the stream to go sub-surface with isolated deep pools for about 300m downstream. Fish were observed in the outlet pool of crossing `r as.character(my_site2)`. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us') %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` for salmonid rearing and spawning.

<br>

## Stream Characteristics Upstream of `r as.character(my_site2)` {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us')` `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198934-04)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198934-d02))."))` The stream was small with moderate flow and had few deep pools for resident overwintering fish. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us')` 

The stream forked approximately 200 meters upstream of the crossing, and the west fork was assessed for a further 550m. Just north of the stream was a cut block with quad bridge on an unmapped crossing. Roughly 1.1km upstream on the east fork, rainbow trout have been documented in the past [@norris2024smnorrisbcfishobs; @moe2024KnownBC]. The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site2) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` value for salmonid rearing and spawning. 

<br>

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, it is recommended to replace crossings `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)` with embedded culverts (streambed simulation), with spans of `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m and `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site2, col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m, respectively. While these estimates are preliminary, the rough cost of the work for each crossing is estimated at
\$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')`.

<br>

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossings `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site)` are promising sites to follow-up with fish sampling due to their favourable habitat conditions, observed fish presence, and the potential barriers posed by outlet drops on both culverts. Conducting fish sampling at these sites will provide valuable data to guide future prioritization and replacement efforts. However, it's worth noting that crossing `r as.character(my_site)` has 8m of road fill above the culvert, which could significantly increase the cost of replacement.
