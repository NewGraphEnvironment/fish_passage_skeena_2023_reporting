<p>Wet’suwet’en hereditary territory covers an area of 22,000km<sup>2</sup> including the Bulkley River and Morice River watersheds and portions of the Nechako River watershed. The Wet’suwet’en people are a matrilineal society organized into the Gilseyhu (Big Frog), Laksilyu (Small Frog), Tsayu (Beaver clan), Gitdumden (Wolf/Bear) and Laksamshu (Fireweed) clans. Within each of the clans there are are a number of kin-based groups known as Yikhs or House groups. The Yikh is a partnership between the people and the territory. Thirteen Yikhs with Hereditary Chiefs manage a total of 38 distinct territories upon which they have jurisdiction. Within a clan, the head Chief is entrusted with the stewardship of the House territory to ensure the Land is managed in a sustainable manner. Inuk Nu’at’en (Wet’suwet’en law) governing the harvesting of fish within their lands are based on values founded on thousands of years of social, subsistence and environmental dynamics. The Yintahk (Land) is the centre of life as well as culture and it’s management is intended to provide security for sustaining salmon, wildlife, and natural foods to ensure the health and well-being of the Wet’suwet’en <span class="citation">(Office of the Wet’suwet’en 2013; <span>“Office of the <span>Wet</span>’suwet’en”</span> 2021; FLNRORD 2017)</span>.</p>

The Laxyip is governed by 60 Simgiigyet (Hereditary Chiefs), within the traditional hereditary system made up of Wilps (House groups). Anaat are fisheries tenures found throughout the Laxyip. Traditional governance within a matrilineal society operates under the principles of Ayookw (Gitxsan law) <span class="citation">(<span>“Gitxsan <span>Huwilp Government</span>”</span> n.d.)</span>.

<p>The Kitsumkalum community, part of the Tsimshian Nation, maintains a rich cultural heritage rooted in ancient traditions and values. Their society, governed by Tsimshian Law (ayaawx), emphasizes strong connections through marriages, adoptions, and resource sharing with other Tsimshian tribes. The community upholds its cultural and spiritual practices, including fishing, harvesting, and land stewardship, despite the impacts of colonization <span class="citation">(Kitsumkalum Band n.d.)</span>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Kitsumkalum’s social structure is based on matrilineal kinship, with significant emphasis on family ties through the mother’s lineage. Their cultural identity is expressed through crest groups (pteex), lineage houses (waap), and the importance of landed property (laxyuup), which ties them to their ancestral territories. The community combines traditional governance with modern administrative functions, reflecting their resilience and commitment to preserving their heritage <span class="citation">(Kitsumkalum Band n.d.)</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Bulkley River<a href="background.html#bulkley-river" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The Bukley River is an 8th order stream that drains an area of 7,762km<sup>2</sup> in a generally northerly direction from Bulkley Lake on the Nechako Plateau to its confluence with the Skeena River at Hazleton. It has a mean annual discharge of 139.1 m<sup>3</sup>/s at station 08EE004 located near Quick (~27km south of Telkwa) and 19 m<sup>3</sup>/s at station 08EE003 located upstream near Houston. Flow patterns at Quick are heavily influenced by inflows from the Morice River (enters just downstream of Houston) resulting in flow patterns typical of high elevation watersheds which receive large amounts of precipitation as snow leading to peak levels of discharge during snowmelt, typically from May to July (Figures <a href="background.html#fig:hydrology-plot">2.2</a> - <a href="background.html#fig:hydrology-stats1">2.3</a>). The hydrograph peaks faster and generally earlier (May - June) for the Bulkley River upstream of Houston where the topography is of lower lower elevation (Figures <a href="background.html#fig:hydrology-plot">2.2</a> and <a href="background.html#fig:hydrology-stats2">2.4</a>).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Changes to the climate systems are causing impacts to natural and human systems on all continents with alterations to hydrological systems caused by changing precipitation or melting snow and ice increasing the frequency and magnitude of extreme events such as floods and droughts <span class="citation">(Calvin et al. 2023; ECCC 2016)</span>. These changes are resulting in modifications to the quantity and quality of water resources throughout British Columbia and are likely to compound issues related to drought and flooding in the Bulkley River watershed where numerous water licenses are held with a potential over-allocation of flows identified during low flow periods <span class="citation">(ILMB 2007)</span>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The valley bottom has seen extensive settlement over the past hundred years with major population centers including the Village of Hazelton, the Town of Smithers, the Village of Telkwa and the District Municipality of Houston. As a major access corridor to northwestern British Columbia, Highway 16 and the Canadian National Railway are major linear developments that run along the Bulkley River within and adjacent to the floodplain with numerous crossing structures impeding fish access into and potentially out from important fish habitats. Additionally, as the valley bottom contains some of the most productive land in the area, there has been extensive conversion of riparian ecosystems to hayfields and pastures leading to alterations in flow regimes, increases in water temperatures, reduced streambank stability, loss of overstream cover and channelization <span class="citation">(ILMB 2007; Wilson and Rabnett 2007)</span>.</p>

<p>The Morice River watershed drains 4,379km<sup>2</sup> of Coast Mountains and Interior Plateau in a generally south-eastern direction. The Morice River is an 8th order stream that flows approximatley 80km from Morice Lake to the confluence with the upper Bulkley River just north of Houston. Major tributaries include the Nanika River, the Atna River, Gosnell Creek and the Thautil River. There area numerous large lakes situated on the south side of the watershed including Morice Lake, McBride Lake, Stepp Lake, Nanika Lake, Kid Price Lake, Owen Lake and others. There is one active hydrometric station on the mainstem of the Morice River near the outlet of Morice Lake and one historic station that was located at the mouth of the river near Houston that gathered data in 1971 only <span class="citation">(Canada 2024)</span>. An estimate of mean annual discharge for the one year of data available for the Morice near it’s confluence with the Bulkley River is 113 m<sup>3</sup>/s. Mean annual discharge is estimated at 75 m<sup>3</sup>/s at station 08ED002 located near the outlet of Morice Lake. Flow patterns are typical of high elevation watersheds influenced by coastal weather patterns which receive large amounts of winter precipitation as snow in the winter and large precipitation events in the fall. This leads to peak levels of discharge during snowmelt, typically from May to July with isolated high flows related to rain and rain on snow events common in the fall (Figures <a href="background.html#fig:hydrology-plot2">2.5</a> - <a href="background.html#fig:hydrology-stats3">2.6</a>).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> Zymoetz River<a href="background.html#zymoetz-river" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The Zymoetz River (known locally as the Copper River) watershed is an eighth order stream that drains an area of 3026km<sup>2</sup> in a generally westerly direction. It is considered a major tributary of the Skeena River, as it contributes approximately 10% of the flow. The headwater lakes are located approximately 20km southwest of Smithers, and they include Aldrich, Dennis and McDonell Lakes. The upper and lower portions of the watershed are accessed via logging roads off of Highway 16 from Smithers and Terrace, respectively. Access to the middle watershed is difficult due to road wash out. The Zymoetz River flows roughly 120km, starting just west of Hudson Bay mountain near Smithers and ending at the confluence of the Skeena River, approximately 8km north-east of Terrace. Elevations in the watershed range from 120m at the confluence, to 2740m in the Howson Range. The Duthie mine operated on the south-west slope of Hudson Bay Mountain during the 1930’s and 1950’s, and reports have documented contaminated streams and lakes in the surrounding area <span class="citation">(Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall 2002)</span>. The lower end of the Zymoetz watershed has seen a significant reduction in riparian habitat due to fires, forest development practices, pipe line and road construction <span class="citation">(Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall 2002)</span>. Snowmelt plays a big role in controlling the stream hydrology, with a mean annual discharge estimated at 106 m<sup>3</sup>/s at station 08EF005 located near Smithers. Peak discharge happens in May to early June, which is typical of a high elevation watershed like this (Figures <a href="background.html#fig:hydrology-plot3">2.7</a> - <a href="background.html#fig:hydrology-stats4">2.8</a>).</p>

<p>The Kispiox River watershed is a seventh order stream that drains an area of 2100km<sup>2</sup> in a south east direction. It is a large tributary of the Skeena River, contributing approximately 9% of its flow. It flows 140km to the confluence of the Skeena River, near Kispiox Village. Elevations in the watershed range from 200m at the mouth to as high as 2090m on Kispiox Mountain. The mainstream of the Kispiox is fed mainly by glacier melt and high elevation snow melt. Swan and Stephens Lakes (located in the upper watershed) are important sockeye systems. Swan Lake drains via Club Lake into Stephens Lake which in turn flows via Stephens Creek into the mainstem of the Kispiox River. Some of the biggest threats to aquatic ecosystems in the Kispiox valley are reported as erosion, obstructions, sedimentation, and altered water yield. The upper third of the Kispiox watershed (upstream of the Nangeese River) is well protected from development by the Swan Lake Kispiox River Provincial Park and because it contains few roads with little forestry development <span class="citation">(Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall 2002)</span>. The Kispiox River has a mean annual discharge estimated at 45 m<sup>3</sup>/s at station 08EB004 located near Hazelton. Peak discharge happens in May and June as a result of the spring snowmelt (Figures <a href="background.html#fig:hydrology-plot4">2.9</a> - <a href="background.html#fig:hydrology-stats5">2.10</a>).</p>

<p>Renowned as a world class recreational steelhead and coho fishery, the greater Bulkley River receives some of the heaviest angling pressure in the province. In response to longstanding angler concerns with respect to overcrowding, quality of experience and conflict amongst anglers, an Angling Management Plan was drafted for the river following the initiation of the Skeena Quality Waters Strategy process in 2006 and an extensive multi-year consultation process. The plan introduces a number of regulatory measures with the intent to provide Canadian resident anglers with quality steelhead fishing opportunities. Regulatory measures introduced with the Angling Management Plan include prohibited angling for non-guided non-resident aliens on Saturdays and Sundays, Sept 1 - Oct 31 within the Bulkley River, angling prohibited for non-guided non-resident aliens on Saturdays and Sundays, all year within the Suskwa River and angling prohibited for non-guided non-resident aliens Sept 1 - Oct 31 in the Telkwa River.

<p>Within the Zymoetz Watershed, there are many areas with high fishery values. Steelhead are the most extensively documented fish species in the Zymoetz River watershed. Adults enter the river from July to November and then go on to spawn the following year in late spring to early summer. The Zymoetz River is a relatively steep system. Two canyons are located 6.4 and 19.6 kilometers upstream of the Skeena River confluence. These canyons make access to the Zymoetz difficult for pink and chum salmon <span class="citation">(Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall 2002)</span>. The Zymoetz River is renowned for its aggressive steelhead that have been known to take flies or lures. There is a 50km stretch upstream of Limonite Creek that’s very remote and offers high quality fishing opportunities for anglers <span class="citation">(FLNRORD 2013)</span>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Traditional First Nations use of the upper Zymoetz River watershed by the Gitxsan and Wet’suwet’en people differed between community sites, residences, and fish houses, and was large and diverse. From the upper to lower Zymoetz River and to the Skeena River, a significant ancient grease trail connected, with a branch track forking through Limonite Creek and flowing down the Telkwa River. The fishery used a weir at the mouth of McDonell Lake and spears at Six Mile Flats, near Dennis Lake. There is no information on native fisheries on the lower Zymoetz River. The Zymoetz is considered to be one of the top ten steelhead rivers in BC <span class="citation">(Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall 2002)</span>.</p>

<p>Kispiox River salmon are a important food source and cultural symbol for the Gitxsan people with sockeye and coho historically the two most significant species. Gitangwalk and Lax Didax, two significant villages that were both abandoned in the early 1900s, were situated on the Kispiox in such a way as to block the sockeye and coho salmon’s upstream migration to the Upper Kispiox River spawning grounds providing opportunities to gather and preserve a significant amount of high-quality food over relatively short time periods <span class="citation">(Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall 2002)</span>. The 100 km of mainstem and 300km of tributary streams in the Kispiox River Watershed are considering high value fish habitat supporting migration, spawning and rearing for many fish species. The Kispiox fisheries supports both recreational and commercial fishing while also enhancing the ecology, nutrient regime, and structural diversity of the drainage. Since 1992, sockeye and coho escapements from the Kispiox Watershed have been documented by the Gitxsan Watershed Authorities as they creates strong cultural, economic, and symbolic ties for the local communities <span class="citation">(Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall 2002)</span>.</p>

<p>The Kitsumkalum River is an important waterway for all species of salmon. It is one of the three main chinook producing rivers in the Skeena watershed and supports all five species of pacific salmon, steelhead, and other resident trout and char species <span class="citation">(McElhanney 2022)</span>. Most notably, the Kitsumkalum River has consistently produced the largest-bodied chinook in the Skeena Watershed, as well as on most of the Pacific coast <span class="citation">(A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett 2007)</span>. The watershed supports strong recreational coho, steelhead, and chinook fishing. Kitsumkalum salmon also play an important role in the culture and economy of the Kitsumkalum Band <span class="citation">(A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett 2007)</span>.</p>

<p>Fish species recorded in the Morice, Bulkley, Zymoetz, Kispiox, and Kitsumkalum Rivers watershed groups are detailed in Table <a href="background.html#tab:fiss-species-table">2.2</a> <span class="citation">(MoE 2019a)</span>. Coastal cutthrout trout and bull trout are considered of special concern (blue-listed) provincially. Summaries of some of the Skeena fish species life history, biology, stock status, and traditional use are documented in <span class="citation">Schell (2003)</span>, <span class="citation">Wilson and Rabnett (2007)</span>, <span class="citation">Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall (2002)</span> and <span class="citation">Office of the Wet’suwet’en (2013)</span>. <span class="citation">Wilson and Rabnett (2007)</span> discuss chinook, pink, sockeye, coho, steelhead and indigenous freshwater Bulkley River fish stocks within the context of key lower and upper Bulkley River habitats such as the Suskwa River, Station Creek, Harold Price Creek, Telkwa River and Buck Creek. Key areas within the upper Bulkley River watershed with high fishery values, documented in <span class="citation">Schell (2003)</span>, are the upper Bulkley mainstem, Buck Creek, Dungate Creek, Barren Creek, McQuarrie Creek, Byman Creek, Richfield Creek, Johnny David Creek, Aitken Creek and Emerson Creek.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Some key areas of high fisheries values for chinook, sockeye and coho are noted in <span class="citation">Bustard and Schell (2002)</span> as McBride Lake, Nanika Lake, and Morice Lake watersheds. A draft gantt chart for select species in the Morice River and Bulkley River watersheds was derived from reviews of the aforementioned references and is included as Figure <a href="background.html#fig:fish-gantt-morice">2.13</a>. The data is considered in draft form and will be refined over the spring and summer of 2021 with local fisheries technicians and knowledge holders during the collaboratory assessment planning and fieldwork activities planned.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the 1990’s the Morice River watershed, <span class="citation">A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett (2007)</span> estimated that chinook comprised 30% of the total Skeena system chinook escapements. It is estimated that Morice River coho comprise approximatley 4% of the Skeena escapement with a declining trend noted since the 1950 in <span class="citation">A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett (2007)</span>. Coho spawn in major tributaries and small streams ideally at locations where downstream dispersal can result in seeding of prime off channel habitats including warm productive sloughs and side channels. Of all the salmon species, coho rely on small tributaries the most <span class="citation">(Bustard and Schell 2002)</span>. <span class="citation">Bustard and Schell (2002)</span> report that much of the distribution of coho into non-natal tributaries occurs during high flow periods of May - early July with road culverts blocking migration into these habitats.</p>

A Fish Passage Technical Working Group has been formed to coordinate the protocol and data is continuously amalgamated within the Provincial Steam Crossing Inventory System (PSCIS). The strategic approach protocol involves a four-phase process as described in @fishpassagetechnicalworkinggroupFishPassageStrategic2014 :</span></span>

No habitat confirmations are recorded in the PSCIS database [@moe2021PSCISHabitat]. Within the Bulkley River watershed group, a number of remediation projects have been completed over the years with backwatering works conducted on Toboggan Creek, Coffin Creek, Moan Creek, Johnny David Creek and potentially others. Three culvert replacements (with open bottom structures) in the watershed group have been tracked in PSCIS and include works on Barren Creek as well as two tributaries to Harold Prince Creek [@moe2021PSCISRemediation]. McDowell Creek at Highway 16 was replaced with a horizontally drilled baffled structure in 2017 and a design is currently being drafted for the Highway 16 crossing over Taman Creek (pers. comm.
