Partnerships are key to conserving BC’s wildlife, fish, and their habitats. "],["intro.html", "1 Introduction", " 1 Introduction Since 2020, the Society for Ecosystem Restoration Northern British Columbia (SERNbc) has been undertaking an initiative to plan and conduct fish passage restoration planning activities in the Bulkley River and Morice River watershed groups which are sub-basins of the Skeena River watershed. The study area was expanded in 2022 to include the Zymoetz Watershed Group and the Kispiox River watershed group. This report builds on reporting from field activities conducted in 2020 (Irvine 2021) and 2021 which can be viewed interactively here and here. Additionally, although part of the same overall intitive, to facilitate timelines, reporting for field activities conducted in the Bulkley River Watershed Group in 2022 have been included under separate cover and can be viewed here. Please note that at the time of reporting, this document was a living document changing over time. Version numbers are logged for each release with modifications, enhancements and other changes tracked here. Issues and planned enhancements are tracked here. The health and viability of freshwater fish populations can depend on access to tributary and off channel areas which provide refuge during high flows, opportunities for foraging, overwintering habitat, spawning habitat and summer rearing habitat (Bramblett et al. 2002; Swales and Levings 1989; Diebel et al. 2015). Culverts can present barriers to fish migration due to low water depth, increased water velocity, turbulence, a vertical drop at the culvert outlet and/or maintenance issues (Slaney, Zaldokas, and Watershed Restoration Program (B.C.) 1997; Cote et al. 2005). As road crossing structures are commonly upgraded or removed there are numerous opportunities to restore connectivity by ensuring that fish passage considerations are incorporated into repair, replacement, relocation and deactivation designs. Although remediation and replacement of stream crossing structures can have benefits to local fish populations, the costs of remedial works can be significant and the impacts of the work often complex to evaluate and quantify. Additionally, allocation of ecosystem restoration funding towards infrastructure upgrades on transportation right of ways are not always considered ethical under all circumstances from all perspectives. When funds are finite and invested groups are engaged in fund raising, cost benefits and the ethics of crossing replacements should be explored collaboratively alongside the cost benefits and ethics of alternative investment activities including transportation corridor relocation/deactivation, land procurement/covenant, cattle exclusion, riparian/floodplain restoration, habitat complexing, water conservation, commercial/recreational fishing management, salt water interventions and research.

The Wet’suwet’en people are a matrilineal society organized into the Gilseyhu (Big Frog), Laksilyu (Small Frog), Tsayu (Beaver clan), Gitdumden (Wolf/Bear) and Laksamshu (Fireweed) clans. Within each of the clans there are are a number of kin-based groups known as Yikhs or House groups. The Yikh is a partnership between the people and the territory. Thirteen Yikhs with Hereditary Chiefs manage a total of 38 distinct territories upon which they have jurisdiction. Within a clan, the head Chief is entrusted with the stewardship of the House territory to ensure the Land is managed in a sustainable manner. Inuk Nu’at’en (Wet’suwet’en law) governing the harvesting of fish within their lands are based on values founded on thousands of years of social, subsistence and environmental dynamics. The Yintahk (Land) is the centre of life as well as culture and it’s management is intended to provide security for sustaining salmon, wildlife, and natural foods to ensure the health and well-being of the Wet’suwet’en (Office of the Wet’suwet’en 2013; “Office of the Wet’suwet’en” 2021; FLNRORD 2017). 2.2 Gitxsan Gitxsan means “People of the River Mist”. The Gitxsan Laxyip (traditional territories) covers an area of 33,000km2 within the Skeena River and Nass River watersheds. The Laxyip is governed by 60 Simgiigyet (Hereditary Chiefs), within the traditional hereditary system made up of Wilps (House groups). Anaat are fisheries tenures found throughout the Laxyip. Traditional governance within a matrilineal society operates under the principles of Ayookw (Gitxsan law) (“Gitxsan Huwilp Government” 2021). Many band members live in Hazelton, Kispiox and Glen Vowell (the Eastern Gitxsan) as well as within Kitwanga, Kitwankool and Kitsegukla (the Western Gitxsan) (Powell, Jensen, and Pedersen 2018). # Salmon is considered the source of life and always treated with high regard. It was brought by the Raven who also taught people how to fish and hunt. # The original Gitxsan economy depended heavily on the trade of fish and other natural resources with neighbouring First Nations along &quot;grease trails,&quot; which are routes named so because they carried the refined oil of the oolichan, a fish that resembles a smelt that is common in some areas of British Columbia. They are also known for their range of traditional arts 2.3 Project Location knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/fishpassage_overview.png&quot;) Figure 2.1: Overview map of Study Areas 2.3.1 Bulkley River The Bukley River is an 8th order stream that drains an area of 7,762km2 in a generally northerly direction from Bulkley Lake on the Nechako Plateau to its confluence with the Skeena River at Hazleton. It has a mean annual discharge of 139.1 m3/s at station 08EE004 located near Quick (~27km south of Telkwa) and 19 m3/s at station 08EE003 located upstream near Houston. Flow patterns at Quick are heavily influenced by inflows from the Morice River (enters just downstream of Houston) resulting in flow patterns typical of high elevation watersheds which receive large amounts of precipitation as snow leading to peak levels of discharge during snowmelt, typically from May to July (Figures 2.2 - 2.3). The hydrograph peaks faster and generally earlier (May - June) for the Bulkley River upstream of Houston where the topography is of lower lower elevation (Figures 2.2 and 2.4). Changes to the climate systems are causing impacts to natural and human systems on all continents with alterations to hydrological systems caused by changing precipitation or melting snow and ice increasing the frequency and magnitude of extreme events such as floods and droughts (IPCC 2014; ECCC 2016). These changes are resulting in modifications to the quantity and quality of water resources throughout British Columbia and are likely to compound issues related to drought and flooding in the Bulkley River watershed where numerous water licenses are held with a potential over-allocation of flows identified during low flow periods (ILMB 2007). The valley bottom has seen extensive settlement over the past hundred years with major population centers including the Village of Hazelton, the Town of Smithers, the Village of Telkwa and the District Municipality of Houston. As a major access corridor to northwestern British Columbia, Highway 16 and the Canadian National Railway are major linear developments that run along the Bulkley River within and adjacent to the floodplain with numerous crossing structures impeding fish access into and potentially out from important fish habitats. Additionally, as the valley bottom contains some of the most productive land in the area, there has been extensive conversion of riparian ecosystems to hayfields and pastures leading to alterations in flow regimes, increases in water temperatures, reduced streambank stability, loss of overstream cover and channelization (ILMB 2007; Wilson and Rabnett 2007). lfpr_create_hydrograph(&quot;08EE003&quot;, start_year = 1980) lfpr_create_hydrograph(&quot;08EE004&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08EE004.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/pixel.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08EE003.png&quot;) Figure 2.2: Hydrograph for Bulkley River at Quick (Station #08EE004) and near Houston (Station #08EE003). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrology_stats_08EE004.png&quot;) Figure 2.3: Bulkley River At Quick (Station #08EE004 - Lat 54.61861 Lon -126.89997).

The Morice River is an 8th order stream that flows approximatley 80km from Morice Lake to the confluence with the upper Bulkley River just north of Houston. Major tributaries include the Nanika River, the Atna River, Gosnell Creek and the Thautil River. There area numerous large lakes situated on the south side of the watershed including Morice Lake, McBride Lake, Stepp Lake, Nanika Lake, Kid Price Lake, Owen Lake and others. There is one active hydrometric station on the mainstem of the Morice River near the outlet of Morice Lake and one historic station that was located at the mouth of the river near Houston that gathered data in 1971 only (Environment and limate Change Canada 2021). An estimate of mean annual discharge for the one year of data available for the Morice near it’s confluence with the Bulkley River is 113 m3/s. Mean annual discharge is estimated at 75 m3/s at station 08ED002 located near the outlet of Morice Lake. Flow patterns are typical of high elevation watersheds influenced by coastal weather patterns which receive large amounts of winter precipitation as snow in the winter and large precipitation events in the fall. This leads to peak levels of discharge during snowmelt, typically from May to July with isolated high flows related to rain and rain on snow events common in the fall (Figures 2.5 - 2.6). lfpr_create_hydrograph(&quot;08ED002&quot;) lfpr_create_hydrograph(&quot;08ED003&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08ED003.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/pixel.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08ED002.png&quot;) Figure 2.5: Left: Hydrograph for Morice River near Houston (Station #08ED003 - 1971 data only).

Available daily discharge data from 1961 to 2022. 2.3.3 Zymoetz River The Zymoetz River (known locally as the Copper River) watershed is an eighth order stream that drains an area of 3026km2 in a generally westerly direction. It is considered a major tributary of the Skeena River, as it contributes approximately 10% of the flow. The headwater lakes are located approximately 20km southwest of Smithers, and they include Aldrich, Dennis and McDonell Lakes. The upper and lower portions of the watershed are accessed via logging roads off of Highway 16 from Smithers and Terrace, respectively. Access to the middle watershed is difficult due to road wash out. The Zymoetz River flows roughly 120km, starting just west of Hudson Bay mountain near Smithers and ending at the confluence of the Skeena River, approximately 8km north-east of Terrace. Elevations in the watershed range from 120m at the confluence, to 2740m in the Howson Range. The lower end of the Zymoetz watershed has seen a significant reduction in riparian habitat due to fires, forest development practices, pipe line and road construction (Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall 2002). Snowmelt plays a big role in controlling the stream hydrology, with a mean annual discharge estimated at 106 m3/s at station 08EF005 located near Smithers. Peak discharge happens in May to early June, which is typical of a high elevation watershed like this (Figures 2.7 - 2.8). lfpr_create_hydrograph(&quot;08EF005&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08EF005.png&quot;) # knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/pixel.png&quot;) Figure 2.7: Zymoetz River Above O.k.

Creek (Station #08EF005 - Lat 54.49363 Lon -128.32466). Available daily discharge data from 1963 to 2021. 2.3.4 Kispiox River The Kispiox River watershed is a seventh order stream that drains an area of 2100km2 in a south east direction. It is a large tributary of the Skeena River, contributing approximately 9% of its flow. It flows 140km to the confluence of the Skeena River, near Kispiox Village. Elevations in the watershed range from 200m at the mouth to as high as 2090m on Kispiox Mountain. The mainstream of the Kispiox is fed mainly by glacier melt and high elevation snow melt. Swan and Stephens Lakes (located in the upper watershed) are important sockeye systems. Swan Lake drains via Club Lake into Stephens Lake which in turn flows via Stephens Creek into the mainstem of the Kispiox River. Some of the biggest threats to aquatic ecosystems in the Kispiox valley are reported as erosion, obstructions, sedimentation, and altered water yield. The upper third of the Kispiox watershed (upstream of the Nangeese River) is well protected from development by the Swan Lake Kispiox River Provincial Park and because it contains few roads with little forestry development (Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall 2002). The Kispiox River has a mean annual discharge estimated at 45 m3/s at station 08EB004 located near Hazelton. Peak discharge happens in May and June as a result of the spring snowmelt (Figures 2.9 - 2.10). lfpr_create_hydrograph(&quot;08EB004&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08EB004.png&quot;) # knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/pixel.png&quot;) Figure 2.9: Kispiox River Near Hazelton (Station #08EB004 - Lat 55.43385 Lon -127.71616).

Available daily discharge data from 1963 to 2022. 2.3.5 Kitsumkalum River The Kitsumkalum River is a sixth order stream that flows east from the Coast Mountains to Kitsumkalum lake then south to Terrace where it joins the Skeena River, draining an area of 2289km2. Major tributaries to the Kitsumkalum River include the Cedar River, Nelson River, Mayo Creek, Goat Creek, Lean-To Creek and Deep Creek (McElhanney 2022). Peak flows occur in May-June from snow melt with subsequent peaks the fall from rain events (McElhanney 2022). There is one hydrometric station below Kitsumkalum lake which has been active since 2018, and has a mean annual discharge of round(fasstr::calc_longterm_mean(station_number = \"08EG019\")$LTMAD,0)m3/s (Figures 2.11 - 2.12. From 1929-1954, there was a hydrometric station near Terrace, which estimated the mean annual discharge to be 138m3/s. The Kitsumkalum River lies within the traditional territory of the Kitsumkalum Band (part of the Tsimshian Nation), and the word Kitsumkalum translates to “riffles in the water as it runs over the rocks” or “to people of the plateau” (Kitsumkalum Band n.d.). The Kitsumkalum people originally settled in Dalk Gyilakyaw (commonly known as Robin Town), Gitxondakl, and Kitsumkalum village located at the mouth of the river. The Kitsumkalum River salmon populations have been an important part of of their culture and economy (A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett 2007). The Kitsumkalum River watershed has been highly impacted by logging. Many of the tributaries to the Kitsumkalum River have altered channel morphology, increased bedload movement, bank failures, sediment loading, and debris accumulation (A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett 2007). There has been a significant amount of work done to enhance salmon populations within the watershed. The SkeenaWild Conservation Trust is conducting riparian restoration surveys on several tributaries to the Kitsumkalum River, including Willow Creek, Spring Creek, Lean-To Creek, and Deep Creek (Healthy Watersheds Initiative 2021). The Deep Creek Hatchery, operated by the Terrace Salmonid Enhancement Society, has been supporting Kitsumkalum River chinook populations since 1984 (A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett 2007). Additionally, there is a small groundwater facility for the incubation and rearing coho and chum, run by the Kitsumkalum First Nation (A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett 2007). In 2000 The Clear Creek Eastern Side Channel was constructed to enhance juvenile rearing habitat and adult spawning habitat for coho salmon on Clear Creek, a tributary to the Kitsumkalum River, however the site has not been maintained and beaver activity has obstructed fish accessibility to much of the channel (Elmer 2021). lfpr_create_hydrograph(&quot;08EG019&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08EG019.png&quot;) Figure 2.11: Kitsumkalum River Below Alice Creek (Station #08EG019 - Lat 54.6793 Lon -128.74396).

Available daily discharge data from 2018 to 2022. 2.4 Fisheries In 2004, IBM Business Consulting Services (2006) estimated the value of Skeena Fisheries at an annual average of $110 million dollars. The Bulkley-Morice watershed is an integral part of the salmon production in the Skeena drainage and supports an internationally renown steelhead, chinook and coho sport fishery (Tamblyn 2005). 2.4.1 Bulkley River Traditionally, the salmon stocks passing through and spawning in the greater Bulkley River were the principal food source for the Gitxsan and Wet’suwet’en people living there (Wilson and Rabnett 2007). Anadromous lamprey passing through and spawning in the upper Bulkley River were traditionally also an important food source for the Wet’suwet’en (A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett (2007); pers comm. Mike Ridsdale, Environmental Assessment Coordinator, Office of the Wet’suwet’en). A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett (2007) report sourceing information from Department of Fisheries and Oceans (1991) that principal spawning areas for chinook in the Neexdzii Kwah include the mainstem above and below Buck and McQuarrie Creeks, between Cesford and Watson Creeks, and the reaches upstream and downstream of Bulkley Falls. Renowned as a world class recreational steelhead and coho fishery, the greater Bulkley River receives some of the heaviest angling pressure in the province. In response to longstanding angler concerns with respect to overcrowding, quality of experience and conflict amongst anglers, an Angling Management Plan was drafted for the river following the initiation of the Skeena Quality Waters Strategy process in 2006 and an extensive multi-year consultation process. The plan introduces a number of regulatory measures with the intent to provide Canadian resident anglers with quality steelhead fishing opportunities. Regulatory measures introduced with the Angling Management Plan include prohibited angling for non-guided non-resident aliens on Saturdays and Sundays, Sept 1 - Oct 31 within the Bulkley River, angling prohibited for non-guided non-resident aliens on Saturdays and Sundays, all year within the Suskwa River and angling prohibited for non-guided non-resident aliens Sept 1 - Oct 31 in the Telkwa River. The Neexdzii Kwah is considered Class II water and there is no fshing permitted upstream of the Morice/Bulkley River Confluence (FLNRO 2013a, 2013b; FLNRORD 2019). 2.4.1.1 Upper Bulkley Falls A detailed field assessment and write up regarding the upper Bulkley falls was conducted as part of fish passage restoration in the watershed - is presented in Irvine (2021) with a condensed summary here. The site was assessed on October 28, 2021 by Nallas Nikal, B.i.T, and Chad Lewis, Environmental Technician. The top of the falls is located at 11U.678269.6038266 at an elevation of 697m approximatley 11.3km downstream of Bulkley Lake and upstream of Ailport Creek. Within the Bulkley River immediately below the 12 - 15m high bedrock falls, channel width was 17.4m and the wetted width was 15.6m. Two channels comprised the falls. The primary channel was 20m long, had a channel/wetted width of 8.5m, a 16% grade and water depths ranging from 35 - 63cm. The secondary channel was 25m long, with channel/wetted widths of 7.5m, a grade of 12% and water depths ranging from 3 - 13cm (Irvine 2021). Dyson (1949) and Stokes (1956) report substantial use of habitat above Bulkley Falls by steelhead, chinook, coho and sockeye utilization in the past (pre-1950) based on spawning reports. Both authors concluded that the Bulkley Falls pose a partial obstruction to migrating fish based on flow levels. Chinook, which migrate early in the summer when water levels are high, have been noted as able to ascend the falls in normal to high water years and in high water years it was thought that coho and steelhead could ascend. A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett (2007) report that the falls are almost completely impassable to all salmon during low water flows. Stokes (1956) reports that there was high value spawning habitat located within the first 3km of the Neexdzii Kwah from the outlet of Bulkley Lake. Wilson and Rabnett (2007) reported that approximately 11.3 km downstream of the Bulkley Lake outlet and just upstream of Watson Creek, the upper Bulkley falls is an approximately 4m high narrow rock sill that crosses the Neexdzii Kwah, producing a steep cascade section. This obstacle to fish passage is recorded as an almost complete barrier to fish passage for salmon during low water flows. Wilson and Rabnett (2007) also reported that coho have not been observed beyond the falls since 1972. 2.4.1.2 Salmon Stock Assessment Data Fisheries and Oceans Canada stock assessment data was accessed via the NuSEDS-New Salmon Escapement Database System through the Open Government Portal with results presented in Table 2.1.

Steelhead are the most extensively documented fish species in the Zymoetz River watershed. Adults enter the river from July to November and then go on to spawn the following year in late spring to early summer. The Zymoetz River is a relatively steep system. Two canyons are located 6.4 and 19.6 kilometers upstream of the Skeena River confluence. These canyons make access to the Zymoetz difficult for pink and chum salmon (Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall 2002). The Zymoetz River is renowned for its aggressive steelhead that have been known to take flies or lures. There is a 50km stretch upstream of Limonite Creek that’s very remote and offers high quality fishing opportunities for anglers (FLNRORD 2013). Traditional First Nations use of the upper Zymoetz River watershed by the Gitxsan and Wet’suwet’en people differed between community sites, residences, and fish houses, and was large and diverse. From the upper to lower Zymoetz River and to the Skeena River, a significant ancient grease trail connected, with a branch track forking through Limonite Creek and flowing down the Telkwa River. The fishery used a weir at the mouth of McDonell Lake and spears at Six Mile Flats, near Dennis Lake. There is no information on native fisheries on the lower Zymoetz River. The Zymoetz is considered to be one of the top ten steelhead rivers in BC (Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall 2002). 2.4.3.1 Salmon Stock Assessment Data Fisheries and Oceans Canada stock assessment data is presented in Table 2.3. dfo_sad_tr %&gt;% dplyr::filter(stringr::str_detect(waterbody,&quot;ZYMOETZ&quot;)) |&gt; # dplyr::select(-waterbody) |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &quot;Fisheries and Oceans Canada stock assessment data for the Zymoetz River.

Gitangwalk and Lax Didax, two significant villages that were both abandoned in the early 1900s, were situated on the Kispiox in such a way as to block the sockeye and coho salmon’s upstream migration to the Upper Kispiox River spawning grounds providing opportunities to gather and preserve a significant amount of high-quality food over relatively short time periods (Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall 2002). The 100 km of mainstem and 300km of tributary streams in the Kispiox River Watershed are considering high value fish habitat supporting migration, spawning and rearing for many fish species. The Kispiox fisheries supports both recreational and commercial fishing while also enhancing the ecology, nutrient regime, and structural diversity of the drainage. Since 1992, sockeye and coho escapements from the Kispiox Watershed have been documented by the Gitxsan Watershed Authorities as they creates strong cultural, economic, and symbolic ties for the local communities (Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall 2002). 2.4.4.1 Salmon Stock Assessment Data Fisheries and Oceans Canada stock assessment data is presented in Table 2.4. dfo_sad_tr %&gt;% dplyr::filter(stringr::str_detect(waterbody,&quot;KISPIOX&quot;)) |&gt; dplyr::select(-waterbody) |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &quot;Fisheries and Oceans Canada stock assessment data for the Zymoetz River.

It is one of the three main chinook producing rivers in the Skeena watershed and supports all five species of pacific salmon, steelhead, and other resident trout and char species (McElhanney 2022). Most notably, the Kitsumkalum River has consistently produced the largest-bodied chinook in the Skeena Watershed, as well as on most of the Pacific coast (A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett 2007). The watershed supports strong recreational coho, steelhead, and chinook fishing. Kitsumkalum salmon also play an important role in the culture and economy of the Kitsumkalum Band (A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett 2007). 2.4.5.1 Salmon Stock Assessment Data Fisheries and Oceans Canada stock assessment data is presented in Table 2.5. dfo_sad_tr %&gt;% dplyr::filter(stringr::str_detect(waterbody,&quot;KITSUMKALUM&quot;)) |&gt; # dplyr::select(-waterbody) |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &quot;Fisheries and Oceans Canada stock assessment data for the Kitsumkalum River.

Coastal cutthrout trout and bull trout are considered of special concern (blue-listed) provincially. Summaries of some of the Skeena fish species life history, biology, stock status, and traditional use are documented in Schell (2003), Wilson and Rabnett (2007), Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall (2002) and Office of the Wet’suwet’en (2013). Wilson and Rabnett (2007) discuss chinook, pink, sockeye, coho, steelhead and indigenous freshwater Bulkley River fish stocks within the context of key lower and upper Bulkley River habitats such as the Suskwa River, Station Creek, Harold Price Creek, Telkwa River and Buck Creek. Key areas within the upper Bulkley River watershed with high fishery values, documented in Schell (2003), are the upper Bulkley mainstem, Buck Creek, Dungate Creek, Barren Creek, McQuarrie Creek, Byman Creek, Richfield Creek, Johnny David Creek, Aitken Creek and Emerson Creek. Some key areas of high fisheries values for chinook, sockeye and coho are noted in Bustard and Schell (2002) as McBride Lake, Nanika Lake, and Morice Lake watersheds. A draft gantt chart for select species in the Morice River and Bulkley River watersheds was derived from reviews of the aforementioned references and is included as Figure 2.13. The data is considered in draft form and will be refined over the spring and summer of 2021 with local fisheries technicians and knowledge holders during the collaboratory assessment planning and fieldwork activities planned. In the 1990’s the Morice River watershed, A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett (2007) estimated that chinook comprised 30% of the total Skeena system chinook escapements. It is estimated that Morice River coho comprise approximatley 4% of the Skeena escapement with a declining trend noted since the 1950 in A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett (2007). Coho spawn in major tributaries and small streams ideally at locations where downstream dispersal can result in seeding of prime off channel habitats including warm productive sloughs and side channels. Of all the salmon species, coho rely on small tributaries the most (Bustard and Schell 2002). Bustard and Schell (2002) report that much of the distribution of coho into non-natal tributaries occurs during high flow periods of May - early July with road culverts blocking migration into these habitats. ##### Chinook # In the 1990&#39;s Morice River watershed, @gottesfeld_rabnett2007SkeenaFish estimated that chinook comprised 30% of the total Skeena system chinook escapements. @buckwalter_kirsch2012Fishinventory have recorded juvenile chinook rearing in small non natal streams. # @buckwalter_kirsch2012Fishinventory have uvenile chinook have been recorded rearing in small non natal streams #It is estimated that Morice River coho comprise approximatley 4% of the Skeena escapement with a declining trend noted since the 1950 in @gottesfeld_rabnett2007SkeenaFish.

A Fish Passage Technical Working Group has been formed to coordinate the protocol and data is continuously amalgamated within the Provincial Steam Crossing Inventory System (PSCIS). The strategic approach protocol involves a four-phase process as described in @fishpassagetechnicalworkinggroupFishPassageStrategic2014 : # # - Phase 1: Fish Passage Assessment -- Fish stream crossings within watersheds with high fish values are assessed to determine barrier status of structures and document a general assessment of adjacent habitat quality and quantity. # - Phase 2: Habitat Confirmation -- Assessments of crossings prioritized for follow up in Phase 1 studies are conducted to confirm quality and quantity of habitat upstream and down as well as to scope for other potential nearby barriers that could affect the practicality of remediation. # - Phase 3: Design -- Site plans and designs are drawn for priority crossings where high value fish habitat has been confirmed. # - Phase 4: Remediation -- Re-connection of isolated habitats through replacement, rehabilitation or removal of prioritized crossing structure barriers. ##`r pscis_historic_phase1 %&gt;% filter(watershed_group_code %ilike% &#39;BULK&#39; &amp; assessment_date &lt; &#39;2020-01-01&#39;) %&gt;% nrow()` ### Bulkley River # There is a rich history of fish passage restoration planning in the Bulkley River watershed group with not all the work documented in the PSCIS system.

All components leveraged R, SQL or Python programming languages to facilitate workflow tracking, collaboration, transparency and continually improving research.

Scripts within bcfishpass also pull and analyze data using other open-source tools such as bcdata (Norris 2021b), bcfishobs (Norris 2021d), and fwapg (Norris 2021a) which serve numerous functions related to open-data access as well as the analysis of the BC Freshwater Atlas, roads, fish and fish habitat in British Columbia. 3.1.1 Habitat Modelling bcfishpass calculates the average gradient of BC Freshwater Atlas stream network lines at minimum 100m long intervals starting from the downstream end of the streamline segment and working upstream. The network lines are broken into max gradient categories with new segments created if and when the average slope of the stream line segment exceeds user provided thresholds. For this project, the user provided gradient thresholds used to delineate “potentially accessible habitat” were based on estimated max gradients that salmon (15% - coho and chinook) and steelhead (20%) are likely to be capable of ascending. Through this initiative and other SERN/New Graph led initiatives, the Provincial Fish Passage Remediation Program and connectivity restoration planning by the Canadian Wildlife Federation (Mazany-Wright et al. 2021), bcfishpass has been designed to prioritize potential fish passage barriers for assessment or remediation. The software is under continual development and has been designed and constructed by Norris (2021c) using sql and python based shell script libraries to generate a simple model of aquatic habitat connectivity. The model identifies natural barriers (ex. steep gradients for extended distances) and hydroelectric dams to classifying the accessibility upstream by fish (Norris 2021c). On potentially accessible streams, scripts identify known barriers (ex. waterfalls &gt;5m high) and additional anthropogenic features which are primarily road/railway stream crossings (i.e. culverts) that are potentially barriers. To prioritize these features for assessment or remediation, scripts report on how much modelled potentially accessible aquatic habitat the barriers may obstruct. The model can be refined with known fish observations upstream of identified barriers and for each crossing location, the area of lake and wetland habitat upstream, species documented upstream/downstream, an estimate of watershed area (on 2nd order and higher streams), mean annual precipitation weighted to upstream watershed area and channel width can be collated using bcfishpass, fwapg and bcfishobs. This, information, can be used to provides an indication of the potential quantity and quality of habitat potentially gained should fish passage be restored by comparing to user defined thresholds for the aforementioned parameters. A discussion of the methodology to derive channel width is below. Gradient, channel size and stream discharge are key determinants of channel morphology and subsequently fish distribution. High value rearing, overwintering and spawning habitat preferred by numerous species/life stages of fish are often located within channel types that have relatively low gradients and large channel widths (also quantified by the amount of flow in the stream). Following delineation of “potentially accessible habitat”, the average gradient of each stream segment within habitat classified as below the 15% and 20% thresholds was calculated and summed within species and life stage specific gradient categories. Average gradient of stream line segments can be calculated from elevations contained in the provincial freshwater atlas streamline dataset. To obtain estimates of channel width upstream of crossing locations, Where available, bcfishpass was utilized to pull average channel gradients from Fisheries Information Summary System (FISS) site assessment data (MoE 2019b) or PSCIS assessment data (MoE 2021) and associate with stream segment lines. When both FISS and PSCIS values were associated with a particular stream segment, FISS channel width was used. When multiple FISS sites were associated with a particular stream segment a mean of the average channel widths was taken. To model channel width for 2nd order and above stream segments without associated FISS or PSCIS sites, first fwapg was used to estimate the drainage area upstream of the segment. Then, rasters from ClimateBC (Wang et al. 2012) were sampled for each stream segments and a mean annual precipitation weighted by upstream watershed area was calculated. Mean annual precipitation was then combined with the channel widths and BEC zone information (gathered through a spatial query tied to the bottom of the stream segment) into a dataset (n = 22990) for analysis fo the relationship between these variables. The details of this analysis and resulting formula used to estimate channel width on stream segments in the Skeena Watershed is included as a technical appendix here. bcfishpass and associated tools have been designed to be flexible in analysis, accepting user defined gradient, channel width and stream discharge categories (MoE 2019b). Although currently in draft form, and subject to development revisions, gradient and channel width thresholds for habitat with the highest intrinsic value for a number of fish species in the Skeena watershed groups have been specified and applied to model habitat upstream of stream crossing locations with the highest intrinsic value (Table 3.1). Thresholds were derived based on a literature review with references provided in Table 3.2. Output parameters for modelling are presented in Table 3.3. #`r if(identical(gitbook_on, FALSE)){knitr::asis_output(&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;)}` bcfishpass_spawn_rear_model %&gt;% mutate(Species = fishbc::fbc_common_name(species_code), spawn_gradient_max = round(spawn_gradient_max * 100 ,1), rear_gradient_max = round(rear_gradient_max * 100 ,1)) %&gt;% select(Species, `Spawning Gradient Max (%)`= spawn_gradient_max, `Spawning Width Min (m)` = spawn_channel_width_min, # `Spawning Width Max (m)` = spawn_channel_width_max, # `Spawning MAD Min (m3/s)` = spawn_mad_min, # `Spawning MAD Max (m3/s)` = spawn_mad_max, `Rearing Gradient Max (%)` = rear_gradient_max, `Rearing Width Min (m)` = rear_channel_width_min) %&gt;% # `Rearing MAD Min (m3/s)` = rear_mad_min, # `Rearing MAD Max (m3/s)` = rear_mad_max, # `Rearing Wetland Multiplier` = rear_wetland_multiplier, # `Rearing Lake Multiplier` = rear_lake_multiplier) %&gt;% t() %&gt;% as_tibble(rownames = &quot;row_names&quot;) %&gt;% janitor::row_to_names(row_number = 1) %&gt;% rename(Variable = Species) %&gt;% select(-`Westslope Cutthroat Trout`, -`Arctic Grayling`, -`Kokanee`, -`Bull Trout`, -`Rainbow Trout`) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Stream gradient and channel width thresholds used to model potentially highest value fish habitat.&#39;, scroll = F) Table 3.1: Stream gradient and channel width thresholds used to model potentially highest value fish habitat.

Crossings surveyed included closed bottom structures (CBS), open bottom structures (OBS) and crossings considered “other” (i.e. fords). Photos were taken at surveyed crossings and when possible included images of the road, crossing inlet, crossing outlet, crossing barrel, channel downstream and channel upstream of the crossing and any other relevant features. The following information was recorded for all surveyed crossings: date of inspection, crossing reference, crew member initials, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, stream name, road name and kilometer, road tenure information, crossing type, crossing subtype, culvert diameter or span for OBS, culvert length or width for OBS. A more detailed “full assessment” was completed for all closed bottom structures and included the following parameters: presence/absence of continuous culvert embedment (yes/no), average depth of embedment, whether or not the culvert bed resembled the native stream bed, presence of and percentage backwatering, fill depth, outlet drop, outlet pool depth, inlet drop, culvert slope, average downstream channel width, stream slope, presence/absence of beaver activity, presence/absence of fish at time of survey, type of valley fill, and a habitat value rating. Habitat value ratings were based on channel morphology, flow characteristics (perennial, intermittent, ephemeral), fish migration patterns, the presence/absence of deep pools, un-embedded boulders, substrate, woody debris, undercut banks, aquatic vegetation and overhanging riparian vegetation (Table 3.4). For crossings determined to be potential barriers or barriers based on the data (see Barrier Scoring), a culvert fix and recommended diameter/span was proposed. fpr_table_habvalue %&gt;% knitr::kable(caption = &#39;Habitat value criteria (Fish Passage Technical Working Group, 2011).&#39;, booktabs = T) %&gt;% kableExtra::column_spec(column = 1, width_min = &#39;1.5in&#39;) %&gt;% kableExtra::kable_styling(c(&quot;condensed&quot;), full_width = T, font_size = font_set) Table 3.4: Table 3.5: Habitat value criteria (Fish Passage Technical Working Group, 2011). Habitat Value Fish Habitat Criteria High The presence of high value spawning or rearing habitat (e.g., locations with abundance of suitably sized gravels, deep pools, undercut banks, or stable debris) which are critical to the fish population. Medium Important migration corridor. Presence of suitable spawning habitat. Habitat with moderate rearing potential for the fish species present. Low No suitable spawning habitat, and habitat with low rearing potential (e.g., locations without deep pools, undercut banks, or stable debris, and with little or no suitably sized spawning gravels for the fish species present). 3.2.1 Barrier Scoring Fish passage potential was determined for each stream crossing identified as a closed bottom structure as per BC Ministry of Environment (2011). The combined scores from five criteria: depth and degree to which the structure is embedded, outlet drop, stream width ratio, culvert slope, and culvert length were used to screen whether each culvert was a likely barrier to some fish species and life stages (Table 3.6, Table 3.7. These criteria were developed based on data obtained from various studies and reflect an estimation for the passage of a juvenile salmon or small resident rainbow trout (Clarkin et al. 2005 ; Bell 1991; Thompson 2013). tab &lt;- as_tibble(t(fpr_table_barrier_scoring)) %&gt;% mutate(V4 = names(fpr_table_barrier_scoring)) %&gt;% select(V4, everything()) %&gt;% janitor::row_to_names(1) %&gt;% ##turn the table sideways mutate(Risk = case_when(Risk == &#39;Value&#39; ~ &#39; Value&#39;, T ~ Risk)) tab %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Fish Barrier Risk Assessment (MoE 2011).&#39;, scroll = F) Table 3.6: Fish Barrier Risk Assessment (MoE 2011).

Cumlative Score Result 0-14 passable 15-19 potential barrier &gt;20 barrier 3.2.2 Cost Benefit Analysis A cost benefit analysis was conducted for each crossing determined to be a barrier based on an estimate of cost associated with remediation or replacement of the crossing with a structure that facilitates fish passage and the amount of potential habitat that would be made available by remediating fish passage at the site (habitat gain index). 3.2.2.1 Habitat Gain Index The habitat gain index is the quantity of modelled habitat upstream of the subject crossing and represents an estimate of habitat gained with remediation of fish passage at the crossing. For this project, a gradient threshold between accessible and non-accessible habitat was set at 20% (for a minimimum length of 100m) intended to represent the maximum gradient of which the strongest swimmers of anadromous species (steelhead) are likely to be able to migrate upstream. For reporting of Phase 1 - fish passage assessments within the body of this report (Table 3.6), a “total” value of habitat &lt;20% output from bcfishpass was used to estimate the amount of habitat upstream of each crossing less than 20% gradient before a falls of height &gt;5m - as recorded in MoE (2020) or documented in other bcfishpass online documentation. For Phase 2 - habitat confirmation sites, conservative estimates of the linear quantity of habitat to be potentially gained by fish passage restoration, steelhead rearing maximum gradient threshold (7.4%) was used. To generate areas of habitat upstream, the estimated linear length was multiplied by half the downstream channel width measured (overall triangular channel shape) as part of the fish passage assessment protocol. Although these estimates are not generally conservative, have low accuracy and do not account for upstream stream crossing structures they allow a rough idea of the best candidates for follow up. Potential options to remediate fish passage were selected from BC Ministry of Environment (2011) and included: Removal (RM) - Complete removal of the structure and deactivation of the road. Open Bottom Structure (OBS) - Replacement of the culvert with a bridge or other open bottom structure. Based on consultation with FLNR road crossing engineering experts, for this project we considered bridges as the only viable option for OBS type . Streambed Simulation (SS) - Replacement of the structure with a streambed simulation design culvert. Often achieved by embedding the culvert by 40% or more. Based on consultation with FLNR engineering experts, we considered crossings on streams with a channel width of &lt;2m and a stream gradient of &lt;8% as candidates for replacement with streambed simulations. Additional Substrate Material (EM) - Add additional substrate to the culvert and/or downstream weir to embed culvert and reduce overall velocity/turbulence. This option was considered only when outlet drop = 0, culvert slope &lt;1.0% and stream width ratio &lt; 1.0. Backwater (BW) - Backwatering of the structure to reduce velocity and turbulence. This option was considered only when outlet drop &lt; 0.3m, culvert slope &lt;2.0%, stream width ratio &lt; 1.2 and stream profiling indicates it would be effective.. Cost estimates for structure replacement with bridges and embedded culverts were generated based on the channel width, slope of the culvert, depth of fill, road class and road surface type. Road details were sourced from FLNRORD (2020b) and FLNRORD (2020a) through bcfishpass. Interviews with Phil MacDonald, Engineering Specialist FLNR - Kootenay, Steve Page, Area Engineer - FLNR - Northern Engineering Group and Matt Hawkins - MoTi - Design Supervisor for Highway Design and Survey - Nelson were utilized to helped refine estimates. Base costs for installation of bridges on forest service roads and permit roads with surfaces specified in provincial GIS road layers as rough and loose was estimated at $25000/linear m and assumed that the road could be closed during construction and a minimum bridge span of 15m. For streams with channel widths &lt;2m, embedded culverts were reported as an effective solution with total installation costs estimated at $50k/crossing (pers. comm. Phil MacDonald, Steve Page) adjusted for inflation. For larger streams (&gt;6m), span width increased proportionally to the size of the stream (ex. for an 8m wide stream a 12m wide span was prescribed). For crossings with large amounts of fill (&gt;3m), the replacement bridge span was increased by an additional 3m for each 1m of fill &gt;3m to account for cutslopes to the stream at a 1.5:1 ratio. To account for road type, a multiplier table was also generated to estimate incremental cost increases with costs estimated for structure replacement on paved surfaces, railways and arterial/highways costing up to 20 times more than forest service roads due to expenses associate with design/engineering requirements, traffic control and paving. The cost multiplier table (Table 3.8) should be considered very approximate with refinement recommended for future projects. tab_cost_rd_mult_report %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Cost multiplier table based on road class and surface type.&#39;, scroll = F) Table 3.8: Cost multiplier table based on road class and surface type.

Within the “condition” risk category - data was collected and crossings were ranked based on erosion, embankment and blockage issues. The “climate” risk category included ranked assessments of the likelihood of both a flood event affecting the culvert as well as the consequence of a flood event affecting the culvert. Within the “priority” category the following factors were ranked - traffic volume, community access, cost, constructability, fish bearing status and environmental impacts (Table 3.9). This project is still in its early stages with methodology changes likely going forward. xref_moti_climate_names %&gt;% slice(7:nrow(xref_moti_climate_names)) %&gt;% select(spdsht, report) %&gt;% rename(Parameter = spdsht, Description = report) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Climate change data collected at MoTi culvert sites&#39;, scroll = gitbook_on) Table 3.9: Climate change data collected at MoTi culvert sites Parameter Description erosion_issues Erosion (scale 1 low - 5 high) embankment_fill_issues Embankment fill issues 1 (low) 2 (medium) 3 (high) blockage_issues Blockage Issues 1 (0-30%) 2 (&gt;30-75%) 3 (&gt;75%) condition_rank Condition Rank = embankment + blockage + erosion condition_notes Describe details and rational for condition rankings likelihood_flood_event_affecting_culvert Likelihood Flood Event Affecting Culvert (scale 1 low - 5 high) consequence_flood_event_affecting_culvert Consequence Flood Event Affecting Culvert (scale 1 low - 5 high) climate_change_flood_risk Climate Change Flood Risk (likelihood x consequence) 1-6 (low) 6-12 (medium) 10-25 (high) vulnerability_rank Vulnerability Rank = Condition Rank + Climate Rank climate_notes Describe details and rational for climate risk rankings traffic_volume Traffic Volume 1 (low) 5 (medium) 10 (high) community_access Community Access - Scale - 1 (high - multiple road access) 5 (medium - some road access) 10 (low - one road access) cost Cost (scale: 1 high - 10 low) constructability Constructibility (scale: 1 difficult -10 easy) fish_bearing Fish Bearing 10 (Yes) 0 (No) - see maps for fish points environmental_impacts Environmental Impacts (scale: 1 high -10 low) priority_rank Priority Rank = traffic volume + community access + cost + constructability + fish bearing + environmental impacts overall_rank Overall Rank = Vulnerability Rank + Priority Rank priority_notes Describe details and rational for priority rankings 3.4 Habitat Confirmation Assessments Following fish passage assessments, habitat confirmations were completed in accordance with procedures outlined in the document “A Checklist for Fish Habitat Confirmation Prior to the Rehabilitation of a Stream Crossing” (Fish Passage Technical Working Group 2011). The main objective of the field surveys was to document upstream habitat quantity and quality and to determine if any other obstructions exist above or below the crossing. Habitat value was assessed based on channel morphology, flow characteristics (perennial, intermittent, ephemeral), the presence/absence of deep pools, un-embedded boulders, substrate, woody debris, undercut banks, aquatic vegetation and overhanging riparian vegetation. Criteria used to rank habitat value was based on guidelines in Fish Passage Technical Working Group (2011) (Table 3.4). During habitat confirmations, to standardize data collected and facilitate submission of the data to provincial databases, information was collected on “Site Cards”. Habitat characteristics recorded included channel widths, wetted widths, residual pool depths, gradients, bankfull depths, stage, temperature, conductivity, pH, cover by type, substrate and channel morphology (among others). When possible, the crew surveyed downstream of the crossing to the point where fish presence had been previously confirmed and upstream to a minimum distance of 600m. Any potential obstacles to fish passage were inventoried with photos, physical descriptions and locations recorded on site cards. Surveyed routes were recorded with time-signatures on handheld GPS units. Fish sampling was conducted on a subset of sites when biological data was considered to add significant value to the physical habitat assessment information. When possible, electrofishing was utilized within discrete site units both upstream and downstream of the subject crossing with electrofisher settings, water quality parameters (i.e. conductivity, temperature and ph), start location, length of site and wetted widths (average of a minimum of three) recorded. For each fish captured, fork length and species was recorded, with results included within the fish data submission spreadsheet. Fish information and habitat data will be submitted to the province under scientific fish collection permit CB20-611971. 3.5 Reporting Reporting was generated with bookdown (Xie 2016) from Rmarkdown (Allaire et al. 2024) with primarily R (R Core Team 2022) and SQL scripts. The R package fpr contains many specialized custom functions related to the work (Irvine 2022). In addition to numerous spatial layers sourced through the BC Data Catalogue then stored and queried in a local postgresql and sqlite databases data inputs for this project include: Populated Fish Data Submission Spreadsheet Template - V 2.0, January 20, 2020 Populated pscis_assessment_template_v24.xls bcfishpass outputs. Custom CSV file detailing Phase 2 site: priority level for proceeding to design for replacement length of survey upstream and downstream a conservative estimate of the linear length of mainstem habitat potentially available upstream of the crossing fish species confirmed as present upstream of the crossing GPS tracks from field surveys. Photos and photo metadata Version changes are tracked here and issues/planned enhancements tracked here. 3.6 Mapping Mapping was completed by Hillcrest Geographics. pdf maps were generated using QGIS with data supplied via a postgreSQL database. A QGIS layer file defining and symbolizing all layers required for general fish passage mapping was developed and at the time of reporting was kept under version control within bcfishpass.

A total of 43 Phase 1 assessments at sites not yet inventoried into the PSCIS system included 2 crossings considered “passable”, 5 crossings considered “potential” barriers and 34 crossings considered “barriers” according to threshold values based on culvert embedment, outlet drop, slope, diameter (relative to channel size) and length (BC Ministry of Environment 2011). Additionally, although all were considered fully passable, 2 crossings assessed were fords and ranked as “unknown” according to the provincial protocol. A summary of crossings assessed, a cost estimate for remediation and a priority ranking for follow up for Phase 1 sites is presented in Table 4.3. Detailed data with photos are presented in Appendix - Phase 1 Fish Passage Assessment Data and Photos. “Barrier” and “Potential Barrier” rankings used in this project followed BC Ministry of Environment (2011) and reflect an assessment of passability for juvenile salmon or small resident rainbow trout at any flows potentially present throughout the year (Clarkin et al. 2005 ; Bell 1991; Thompson 2013). As noted in Bourne et al. (2011), with a detailed review of different criteria in Kemp and O’Hanley (2010), passability of barriers can be quantified in many different ways. Fish physiology (i.e. species, length, swim speeds) can make defining passability complex but with important implications for evaluating connectivity and prioritizing remediation candidates (Bourne et al. 2011; Shaw et al. 2016; Mahlum et al. 2014; Kemp and O’Hanley 2010). Washington Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife (2009) present criteria for assigning passability scores to culverts that have already been assessed as barriers in coarser level assessments. These passability scores provide additional information to feed into decision making processes related to the prioritization of remediation site candidates and have potential for application in British Columbia. tab_cost_est_phase1 %&gt;% select(`PSCIS ID`:`Cost Est ( $K)`) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Upstream habitat estimates and cost benefit analysis for Phase 1 assessments conducted on sites not yet inventoried in PSCIS.

A total of approximately 9km of stream was assessed, fish sampling utilizing electrofishing surveys were conducted at two streams. Georeferenced field maps are presented in Attachment 1. As collaborative decision making was ongoing at the time of reporting, site prioritization can be considered preliminary. In total, 0 crossings were rated as high priorities for proceeding to design for replacement, 8 crossings were rated as moderate priorities, and 1 crossings were rated as low priorities. Results are summarized in Figure 4.1 and Tables 4.4 - 4.4 with raw habitat and fish sampling data included in digital format here. A summary of preliminary modelling results illustrating the quantity of chinook, coho and steelhead spawning and rearing habitat potentially available upstream of each crossing as estimated by measured/modelled channel width and upstream accessible stream length are presented in Figure 4.2.

Additionally, the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure were procuring a design for PSCIS crossing 124420 on Station Creek (also know as Mission Creek) near New Hazleton (pers. comm. Sean Wong, Environmental Programs, MoTi). 4.5 Phase 4 - Remediations Remediations have been completed for replacement of PSCIS crossing 58159 on McDowell Creek (Irvine 2021) with a clear-span bridge and removal of the collapsed bridge (PSCIS crossing 197912) on Robert Hatch Creek. "],["recommendations.html", "5 Recommendations", " 5 Recommendations Recommendations for potential incorporation into collaborative watershed connectivity planning include: Continue to acquire background information and leverage ongoing research initiatives in the region to collaboratively clarify current conditions and identify limiting factors to inform prioritization and effectiveness monitoring programs. Develop strategies to explore cost and fisheries production benefits of stream crossing structure upgrades alongside alternative/additional restoration and enhancement investments such as land conservation/procurement/covenant, cattle exclusion, riparian restoration, habitat complexing, water conservation, commercial/recreational fishing management, water treatment and research. Ideentify and pursue opportunities to collaborate and leverage initiatives together in study area watersheds (ex. fish passage rehabilitation, riparian restoration and cattle exclusion) for maximum likely restoration benefits. Refine barrier thresholds for road-stream crossing structures to explore metrics specific to life stage and life history types of species of interest. This will further focus efforts of potential remediation actions based on biological attributes (ex. timing of migration, size/direction of fish migrating, population dynamics, etc.) and could result in the consideration of interim “stop-gap” physical works to alter crossing characteristics that can address key connectivity issues yet be significantly less costly than structure replacements (ex. building up of downstream area with rock riffles to decrease the outlet drop size and/or increasing water depth within pipe with baffles and substrate additions). Model fish densities (fish/m2) vs. habitat/water quality characteristics (i.e. gradient, discharge, alkalinity, elevation, riparian health, distance from high order streams, etc.) using historically gathered electrofishing and remotely sensed geodata to inform crossing prioritization, future data acquisition needs and the monitoring of restoration actions. Continue to develop bcfishpass,bcfishobs, fwapg, bcdata and fpr as well as to share open source data analysis and presentation tools that are scaleable and facilitate continual improvement. Tools should continue to be flexible and well documented to allow the future incorporation of alternative fragmentation indicators, habitat gain/value metrics and watershed sensitivity indicators. Continue to collaborate with potential partners to build relationships, explore perspectives and develop “road maps” for aquatic restoration in different situations (MoT roads, rail lines, permit roads of different usages, FSRs, etc.) – documenting the people involved, discussions and processes that are undertaken, funding options, synergies, measures of success, etc. "],["appendix---phase-1-fish-passage-assessment-data-and-photos.html", "Appendix - Phase 1 Fish Passage Assessment Data and Photos", " Appendix - Phase 1 Fish Passage Assessment Data and Photos Location and Stream Data Crossing Characteristics – Date 2023-09-25 Crossing Sub Type Round Culvert PSCIS ID 198906 Diameter (m) 1.6 External ID 8300003 Length (m) 20 Crew MW Embedded No UTM Zone 9 Depth Embedded (m) – Easting 585140 Resemble Channel No Northing 6119115 Backwatered No Stream Chicago Creek Percent Backwatered – Road Highway 16 Fill Depth (m) 4 Road Tenure MOTI Outlet Drop (m) 0.2 Channel Width (m) 3.9 Outlet Pool Depth (m) 0.7 Stream Slope (%) 3 Inlet Drop No Beaver Activity No Slope (%) 4.5 Habitat Value High Valley Fill Deep Fill Final score 34 Barrier Result Barrier Fix type Replace with New Open Bottom Structure Fix Span / Diameter 18 Photos: PSCIS ID 198906.
